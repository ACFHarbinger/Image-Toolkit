# ASP Research Web Search — CV Literature Survey

**Intent:** Direct a research agent to perform a comprehensive, targeted web search across computer vision literature, preprint servers (arXiv), and empirical engineering resources to find methods that directly address the specific, quantified limitations of the Anime Stitch Pipeline (ASP). The agent should surface both foundational theory and practical implementation tips that could be adapted to our architecture.

---

## Background: What the Pipeline Does and Where It Fails

The ASP is a 13-stage research pipeline that assembles **sequential anime video frames into a vertical panorama** showing a character's full body from a pan shot. The canonical problem: the camera pans while the character simultaneously animates, so any two adjacent selected frames show the same background region but the character in a completely different pose. Naively stacking strips creates "torn/doubled" character edges at every seam.

### Current Architecture Summary

```
Frames (58–333 source, ~18 selected)
  → Frame selection (phase correlation, 50px/step greedy)
  → BiRefNet fg/bg mask generation
  → LoFTR pairwise matching + bundle adjustment (LM)
  → ECC sub-pixel affine refinement
  → Canvas construction (translation-only model)
  → Temporal median render (background-only pixels)
  → SEA-RAFT optical flow → ARAP Push+Regularise → midpoint warp (Stage 8.5)
  → Hard-partition seam-DP composite (Laplacian blend)
  → Crop
```

### Quantified Performance (96-test corpus, 55 with ground-truth SSIM)

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| True ASP composites | 52/96 (54%) | Tests where pipeline beats the render gate |
| Avg ASP GT-SSIM | 0.667 | vs simple stitch 0.694 — pipeline loses on average |
| asp_better verdict | 7/55 (13%) | Tests where ASP > simple stitch by GT-SSIM |
| simple_better verdict | 26/55 (47%) | Tests where simple stitch wins |
| Best ASP score | test17=0.887 | Near-perfect case |
| test09 ceiling | raw=0.787, aligned=0.832 | 0.045 gap = frame-timing mismatch |
| test27 ceiling | raw=0.709, aligned=0.748 | 0.040 gap = same cause |
| Alignment gate failures | 2D-motion tests (test08 dx_cv=16.6) | +0.074 from early SCANS fallback |

### Key Implemented Features (do NOT re-suggest these)

1. **SEA-RAFT dense optical flow** (ptlflow) — seam-band crops only, 1280px downscale
2. **ARAP Push + Regularise** (Sýkora 2009) — per-cell SAD block matching → rigid mesh interpolation
3. **BiRefNet foreground/background segmentation** — runs on all frames before compositing
4. **Symmetric midpoint warp** (StabStitch++ principle) — α=0.5 both directions
5. **post_warp_diff escalation** — single-pose fallback when blend residual > 22 lum units
6. **Background-only temporal median** — prevents fg ghosting on background plate
7. **Laplacian-blend seam-DP** — graph-cut seam finding with fg-penalty weight
8. **Smart frame selection** — phase-correlation greedy, 50px min step, BiRefNet probe masks
9. **Fg pixel L1 pose metric** — per-frame gain-normalised masked pixel L1 (background-invariant)
10. **Alignment stability gate** — 75th-pct |dx| > 50px fires SCANS fallback (2D-motion detection)
11. **Ghosting ratio gate** — ASP ghosting > 2× simple stitch triggers fallback
12. **Two-channel phase correlation** — bg-only phase correlation for camera displacement (built, disabled — regressions)

### Definitively Ruled Out (do NOT re-suggest these)

| Approach | Why it failed |
|----------|--------------|
| RAFT vs DIS comparison | Identical SSIM outcomes — flow quality is not the bottleneck |
| Global reference warp (α→1) | Amplifies RAFT noise for flat cel regions; test27 collapsed -0.151 |
| Gradient-based pose similarity | Background structure (lockers, walls) confounds gradient L1 |
| ARAP cell_size tuning (8/16/32px) | No measurable SSIM change |
| Character bounding-box crop | Removes essential background content on vertical pans |
| Lowering post_warp_diff threshold | Scene-dependent; net negative on 5-test corpus |

## The Three Quantified Ceilings You Must Help Break

### Ceiling 1: Animation Timing Mismatch (PRIMARY — affects all tests)

**The core problem in precise terms:** At 24fps video with 50px camera advance per selected frame (~300ms between selections), an animating character moves 10–85px between consecutive selected frames. The midpoint warp reduces this to 5–42px residual at the seam. This residual creates the dominant SSIM penalty.

**Aligned SSIM** (ECC-aligned before comparison): test09 raw=0.787, aligned=0.832 (+0.045). The 0.045 gap is purely from selecting frames at temporal positions that don't match the GT reference. This is irreducible without (a) a better frame selector that picks GT-matching frames, or (b) a better compositing method that eliminates seam artifacts regardless of pose mismatch.

**Specific question:** What is the state of the art in **pose-consistent multi-frame fusion** when:
- The source is animated character video ("on twos/threes" — same cel held 2–3 frames)
- The metric is strict (SSIM vs a specific GT reference)
- No GT temporal metadata is available
- BiRefNet masks for fg/bg separation are available
- RAFT flow is available but insufficient for flat cel regions (aperture problem)

### Ceiling 2: Aperture Problem on Flat Cel-Shaded Regions (SECONDARY)

**The problem:** Anime characters have large flat-color regions (uniform skin, costume). Both RAFT and DIS produce chaotic/zero flow vectors in these regions because there is no intensity gradient to track. The ARAP Push phase (block-matching) helps for textured regions but also fails on flat color. The result: in large flat regions, the optical flow is unreliable, causing the midpoint warp to produce incorrect displacements for exactly the largest visible body parts.

**Specific question:** What methods exist for estimating dense correspondence in **textureless/flat-color regions** in animation or stylized content?

### Ceiling 3: GT Reference Coupling in Frame Selection (STRUCTURAL)

**The problem:** Any change to which frames are selected changes the content of the assembled panorama relative to what the GT reference shows. Even if pose-consistent selection improves visual quality, it diverges from the GT's specific temporal sampling, causing measured SSIM to sometimes decrease. The fg pixel L1 metric (our current best) improved test27 by +0.010 but regressed test04 by -0.024.

**Specific question:** What methods exist for **reference-free quality estimation** of multi-frame composites that don't require a GT comparison? What perceptual quality metrics (IQA) are appropriate for stitching/compositing evaluation?

## Topic A: Pose-Consistent Multi-Frame Fusion for Animation

**Goal:** Select or synthesize frames such that consecutive seam boundaries show the same character pose, reducing animation residuals to near-zero without relying on optical flow.

### A1. "On Twos" Animation Hold Detection

Search for methods that detect **animation holds** — runs of identical or near-identical frames that arise from "on twos/threes" drawing techniques in hand-drawn animation. These holds are natural sampling points where the camera has advanced but the character hasn't changed pose.

Queries to try:

- Literature on "temporal redundancy" in animation encoding (MPEG, H.264 can exploit this)
- Any connection between MPEG P-frame prediction and "hold detection"

### A2. Pose Embedding for Frame Selection

We need a **background-invariant** pose similarity metric to drive frame selection. Gradient L1 and pixel L1 fail because background texture changes as the camera pans.

Queries to try:

## Topic B: Correspondence in Textureless and Flat-Color Regions

This is the **aperture problem on cel-shaded content**. Optical flow methods (RAFT, DIS, PWC-Net) fail on large flat regions because the cost volume is uninformative with no gradient. Block-matching (ARAP Push) also fails when the patch is uniform.

### B1. Segment-Level Correspondences

Instead of per-pixel flow, compute correspondences at the **segment level** — find the corresponding color segment in frame B for each color segment in frame A.

Queries to try:
- "superpixel correspondence flat color region textureless matching"
- "segment-level optical flow cartoon anime animation"
- "AnimeInterp segment guided motion estimation anime"
- "SLIC centroid tracking correspondence textureless region"
- "semantic flow flat region matching keypoint-free"
- "image warping textureless region guided by semantic segmentation"
- "AnimeInterp++ segment-guided motion estimation interpolation"

What to find:
- AnimeInterp (CVPR 2021) and its sequel — these specifically target anime frame interpolation with segment-guided motion. Are the segment correspondence methods transferable to our registration use case?
- SLIC-based centroid tracking for flat regions
- Any color-segment-level matching methods from cartoon colorization or recoloring

### B2. Deep Learning Flow for Stylized Content

Optical flow trained on natural images fails on anime because the domain gap is too large. Are there flow networks trained specifically on animated content?

- Whether the SynthFlow or MPI-Sintel datasets have cartoon-adjacent splits
- Any fine-tuned RAFT variants for anime/cel-shaded content
- Explicit handling of textureless regions in optical flow (e.g., cross-bilateral filtering or confidence-guided regularization)

### B3. Contour/Edge-Guided Deformation

Anime line art is characterized by clear silhouette contours. Can we use contour matching (LSD lines, sketch segments) as a proxy for pose correspondence where pixel-level flow fails?

Queries to try:
- "line segment matching deformation cartoon animation registration"
- "contour correspondence image morphing warping anime"
- "ARAP as-rigid-as-possible cartoon line art collinearity constraint Sykora"

- "sketch-based image morphing line-art deformation"
- "structure-aware image warping line art"
- "thin plate spline TPS warp guided line segment anime"

What to find:

- Subsequent work extending Sýkora's method
- Papers using detected line segments as control points for anime warping
- Methods from sketch/line-art morphing that are specifically robust to the aperture problem

We currently use: bidirectional midpoint warp + ARAP regularization + single-pose fallback. What are we missing?

### D1. Ghost-Free HDR Fusion (structural analogues)

- FDAN or similar alignment networks for HDR that handle large motions
- Any "hard decision" methods (select one frame's pixel, no blending) that outperform soft blending for moving foreground

### D2. Video Inpainting / Outpainting for Seam Completion

- Whether FlowNet/PWCNet's background-flow extraction can be repurposed for this

### E2. Canonical View Normalization for Pose Comparison

The GT-coupling problem: selecting frame i vs frame i+1 (same pose hold) changes the canvas position, shifting the GT comparison by ~50px. What methods normalize for this shift before pose comparison?

- MeshFlow (ECCV 2016) — smooth mesh warp for video stitching
- Whether any of these have been adapted for 2D animation with moving foreground
- Computationally: APAP adds ~0.5s, is it worth it for the 13/96 affine-failure tests?

## Constraints and Priorities for the Search

**Hard constraints (must respect):**
- Inference must run on a single consumer GPU (RTX 3090 Ti, 24GB VRAM)
- Per-dataset budget: 95s total (current), ideally <120s with improvements
- No new training required (use pretrained weights or classical methods only)
- Pipeline is Python 3.11+, PyTorch, OpenCV, scipy
- Must work on anime/stylized content (domain gap is a real concern for methods trained on natural images)

**Priority ordering:**
1. Methods that address the **animation timing / pose consistency** ceiling (most impactful, affects all 55 GT-scored tests)
2. Methods for **flat-color region correspondence** (enables better flow → smaller midpoint-warp residuals)
3. **No-reference quality metrics** (unblocks enabling pose selection without GT-coupling regressions)
4. Methods for **2D motion / diagonal pan detection and handling** (affects the 2D-motion gate failure cases)
5. **Synthesis-based seam fill** (would eliminate single-pose fallback artifacts entirely)

**Special interest:**
- Any method that specifically addresses the **"on twos" anime animation** problem by name
- Methods from the anime/webtoon/comic computer vision literature (SIGGRAPH Asia, NPAR)
- Any **negative results** or reproducibility failures for methods that sound applicable — knowing what definitely doesn't work is as valuable as knowing what does
- Methods that have been validated at the **5–30fps video frame rate** (as opposed to single-image pairs)

**The ideal finding** would be a method that:
1. Can estimate pose similarity between two frames without requiring background-free input
2. Is lightweight enough to run on 30 frame pairs at thumbnail scale (~5ms/pair)
3. Has been tested on animated/cartoon content
4. Produces a distance metric (not just a binary yes/no) for integration into our greedy frame selector
