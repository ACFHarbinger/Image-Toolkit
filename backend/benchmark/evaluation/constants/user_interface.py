# original bare names since most of the codebase (figure_theme.py,
# image_panel.py, panel_grid.py, matplotlib figure builders, ...) imports
# these directly as fixed overlay/annotation colours — that's deliberate, not
# an oversight: a link line or a defect-region outline is drawn *over*
# photographic/anime content, not over the app's own chrome, so keeping it
# constant regardless of the light/dark toggle is the right call, the same
# way most photo tools keep canvas-overlay colours theme-independent. Only
# the widget-chrome stylesheet itself (theme.py's DARK_STYLESHEET /
# LIGHT_STYLESHEET) actually switches with the toggle.
