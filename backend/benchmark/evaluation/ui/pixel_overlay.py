"""Pixel Value Mode's foreground painting for ``ImagePanel``.

This is the feature that was a complete no-op before the rebuild (issue #123
defect 1): ``set_display_mode()`` stored a string that nothing ever read, and
``PIXEL_GRID_ZOOM_THRESHOLD`` was imported and unused.

Free functions over the panel rather than methods on it, so ``image_panel.py``
stays within the repo's 500-LoC file budget (§5.17 / issues #121-#122) and the
painting logic — the part with the subtle coordinate-space rules below — can be
read on its own.

Two rules that are easy to get wrong here:

- **Labels are drawn in device coordinates, with the world transform reset.**
  Sizing a font in *scene* units means its device size gets multiplied by the
  view scale, and past ~30x native that asks FreeType for enormous glyphs, which
  fails outright (``render glyph failed err=62``) and takes the process down.
  That was a real crash, found by the offscreen tests.
- **Both thresholds are in native scale, not zoom factor.** Zoom is relative to
  the fitted view, so the same zoom factor is a wildly different pixel size on a
  1703x1704 panorama than on a 300px crop.
