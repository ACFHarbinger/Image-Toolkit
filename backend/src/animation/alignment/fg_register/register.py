"""Foreground pose registration (Stage 8.5) — the core fix for strip-seam
character misalignment.

Problem
-------
The ASP camera model is translation-only.  It aligns the *background* across
frames perfectly, but the character is *animating* between the frames being
stitched (300–800 ms apart), so its body parts land in two different poses on
either side of every strip seam → the torn / doubled edges visible in test09.

Approach (see research/ASP_Foreground_Assembly_Research.md §5)
------------------------------------------------------------
Both frames are first warped into the same canvas coordinate system by the
existing affines, so the *background* is already aligned.  Any optical flow
that remains on the *foreground* between the two canvas-aligned frames is the
pure animation residual ``A_animation`` (the camera component ``T_camera`` is
removed by the alignment-aware warping — it does not need to be subtracted
explicitly).

We then re-pose both frames' foreground toward the *midpoint* pose
(StabStitch++ bidirectional principle: halves the maximum per-frame
distortion).  The warp magnitude is tapered to zero away from the seam so the
correction is localised to the boundary where it matters (SC-AOF blend-band
principle) and never disturbs canvas regions a single frame owns outright.

    Re-pose the foreground of two canvas-aligned frames toward a shared target
    pose in a tapered band around the seam, so character body parts line up
    across the strip boundary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    warped_a, warped_b : (H, W, 3) uint8
        The two adjacent frames already warped into canvas coordinates (so the
        background is aligned).  ``a`` owns the canvas on one side of
        ``seam_pos``; ``b`` owns the other.
    fg_a, fg_b : (H, W) bool or uint8
        Foreground masks for each warped frame (True / >127 = foreground
        character pixel).  Flow / warp is applied to foreground only.
    seam_pos : int
        Canvas row (axis=0) or column (axis=1) of the ownership boundary.
    axis : int
        0 = vertical scroll (horizontal seam), 1 = horizontal scroll.
    taper_px : float
        Half-width of the seam band over which the warp magnitude tapers to 0.
    max_residual : float
        If the median foreground residual exceeds this, the animation gap is too
        large to warp safely → return inputs unchanged and signal ``warped=False``
        so the caller can fall back to single-pose-per-component (Eden-2006).
    smooth_sigma : float
        Gaussian sigma to smooth the residual flow before warping (suppresses
        per-pixel flow noise that would tear flat cel regions).
    alpha_a, alpha_b : float in [0, 1]
        Fraction of the flow applied to frame a and b respectively.
        alpha_a + alpha_b = 1.0 (enforced).
        Default 0.5/0.5 = symmetric midpoint warp.
        Global-reference strategy sets alpha proportional to temporal distance
        from the reference strip, so strips near the reference warp less and
        distant strips warp more — preventing drift accumulation.
    flow_override : (H, W, 2) float32 array, optional
        §2.10C: If provided, skip RAFT/DIS/ARAP flow estimation entirely and
        use this pre-computed dense flow field directly.  Intended for the
        HITL user-drawn flow tool where the user sketches displacement arrows
        in the SeamDiagnosticDialog and the GUI converts them to a dense field
        via ``_sparse_flow_to_dense()``.  The field is still tapered and
        Gaussian-smoothed before application.

    Returns
    -------
    (adj_a, adj_b, info) where ``adj_a``/``adj_b`` are the re-posed frames and
    ``info`` carries diagnostics (``warped`` bool, ``residual`` median px,
