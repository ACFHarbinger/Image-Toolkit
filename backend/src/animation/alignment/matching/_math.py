    """§1.3E — Project a full 2×3 affine to its best-fit 4-DOF similarity.

    A similarity transform has the form ``[[a, b, tx], [-b, a, ty]]``.  A
    general affine ``[[a, b, tx], [c, d, ty]]`` decomposes as::

        a_sym = (a + d) / 2   (average of diagonal — symmetric part)
        b_sym = (b - c) / 2   (antisymmetric off-diagonal — rotation/scale)

    This is the closed-form least-squares projection onto the similarity
    manifold (Procrustes for 2-D conformal maps).  Shear (asymmetric
    off-diagonal component) is discarded because feature matchers
    (LoFTR, RoMa) cannot reliably distinguish camera shear from
    perspective distortion at anime-panel scales.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : (2, 3) float32 affine matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    (2, 3) float32 similarity matrix with the same translation as M.
