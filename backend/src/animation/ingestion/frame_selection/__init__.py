"""
Pose-consistent smart frame selection for the Anime Stitch Pipeline (§5.17 split).

Problem
-------
Pan-shot anime contains two superimposed motions:
  T_camera  — rigid background translation (the camera panning)
  A_animation — non-rigid character articulation

Selecting frames based solely on camera displacement picks arbitrary animation
phases.  When consecutive selected frames show the character in different poses,
the seam-registration stage (Stage 8.5) must warp one pose toward the other.
The warp is only approximate, leaving residual edge-doubling ("ghost") artifacts.
The SSIM ceiling (test09: 0.787, test27: 0.709) is caused by this animation
timing mismatch, not by compositing quality.

Solution (§6.1 of the Upgrade Research report)
----------------------------------------------
Anime is animated "on twos" or "on threes" — the same character cel is held for
2–3 consecutive video frames.  Within these runs, the background has advanced by
the inter-frame camera step while the character pose is identical.  By detecting
these runs and selecting frames that match the previous anchor pose, we assemble
a panorama from geometrically coherent inputs before rendering begins.

The pose similarity metric is the mean absolute pixel difference on the
foreground region (BiRefNet-masked, per-frame gain-normalised).  Background
pixels are hard-thresholded out so camera-panning background structure
contributes nothing to the score.  Falls back to gradient-magnitude L1 on
the central 50% crop when BiRefNet masks are unavailable.

Algorithm
---------
1. Load all frames at thumbnail scale (no GPU, I/O-bound).
2. Phase-correlate consecutive thumbnails → cumulative canvas positions.
3. Greedy forward-selection with a pose-consistent lookahead window:
   - Accumulate candidates within [min_step_px, min_step_px + pose_window_px]
     of the last selected frame.
   - From the window, pick the candidate with the lowest central-crop L1
     distance to the last selected thumbnail (most pose-similar).
4. Always include the first and last frames.

Configuration
-------------
``ASP_POSE_WINDOW_PX`` (env, default "80") — window width in canvas pixels.
Set to "0" to revert to v1 first-past-threshold behaviour.
``ASP_TWO_CHANNEL_SELECT`` (env, default "0") — enable BiRefNet background mask
for camera displacement estimation (currently disabled; see note below).
