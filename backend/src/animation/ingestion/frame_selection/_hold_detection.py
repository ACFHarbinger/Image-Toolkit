    """
    Detect animation "on twos / on threes" hold blocks and return the index of
    the first frame of each block.

    Anime animators draw a new character cel every 2–3 video frames
    (occasionally every frame for action shots, or every 4–6 for slow scenes).
    Within a hold block, consecutive frames are pixel-identical except for MPEG
    compression noise and sub-pixel camera drift.  At a hold boundary, the
    character snaps to a new pose → large pixel MAD.

    The detector compares consecutive thumbnail mean absolute differences
    (normalised to [0,1]).  If the MAD is below ``hold_threshold``, the two
    frames belong to the same hold block.  The first frame of each block is the
    representative.

    Parameters
    ----------
    thumbs : list of (H, W) float32 thumbnails in [0, 1].
    hold_threshold : mean absolute difference (in [0,1]) below which two
        consecutive thumbnails are considered the same cel.  Default 0.025
        (2.5% of [0,1] range).  Typical within-hold MAD: 0.003–0.010.
        Typical cross-hold MAD: 0.030–0.120.

    Returns
    -------
    List[int] — indices of the first frame of each hold block.  Each block
    represents one unique animation cel.  Length ≤ len(thumbs).

    Notes
    -----
    - For ``hold_threshold=0`` or len(thumbs) ≤ 1, returns list(range(N)).
    - This function is pure NumPy — no GPU, ~1ms for 300 frames.
    - Hold boundaries are the natural pose-change points (Sýkora 2009 §3.1).
      They provide a principled frame universe for Pass 2 pose-consistent
      refinement: candidates that cross exactly one hold boundary are
      guaranteed to show a different character pose (needed for ARAP to have
      useful work to do); candidates that stay within one hold are wasted
      (identical pose → ARAP residual ≈ 0, good — but selection is redundant).
