    """
    Pose similarity metric between two thumbnails.

    **With fg_mask (BiRefNet fg probability at thumbnail scale):**
    Hard-thresholds the mask (> 0.3) to a binary fg_bin, zeroes out all
    background pixels, then computes mean absolute pixel difference on the
    foreground region.  Each frame's fg pixels are independently normalised to
    zero mean / unit std before differencing to remove inter-frame gain
    variations (ECC gain normalisation has not yet run at selection time).

    This is strictly background-invariant: background pixels are exactly 0.0 in
    both masked images, so camera-panning locker/wall/scenery structure
    contributes nothing to the score regardless of mask softness.  For "on
    twos" animation holds (same character cel for 2–3 consecutive frames),
    fg pixels look identical → score ≈ 0.  Across a hold boundary (new
    animation cel), fg pixels shift position → score > 0.

    The previous gradient-weighted approach computed the Sobel gradient on the
    full image and multiplied by fg_mask, so background edges (lockers, walls)
    with fg_mask weight of 0.05–0.1 still contributed proportionally.  This
    masked-pixel approach is background-invariant by construction.

    **Without fg_mask (fallback):**
    Gradient-magnitude L1 on the central 50% crop.  Partly confounded by
    background structure but does not require BiRefNet.

    Returns a non-negative float (0 = identical character region).

    Compute DINOv2 (ViT-S/14) pose embeddings for all frames.

    Returns (N, 384) float32 array of L2-normalised feature vectors, or None
    if DINOv2 is unavailable (no torch.hub access, model weights not cached, etc.).

    The model is loaded once per process and cached in ``_DINOV2_CACHE`` — the
    first call to this function per device incurs the hub-load overhead
    (~5–30s); subsequent calls are instantaneous.

    DINOv2 features are used in Pass 2 of ``smart_select_frames()`` as the
    pose similarity metric.  Cosine distance between frame features captures
    pose difference robustly:
      - Animation holds (same cel, 2–3 consecutive frames) → distance ≈ 0.02–0.05
      - Cross-hold transitions (new cel) → distance ≈ 0.10–0.30
      - Different scenes → distance > 0.50

    This is background-invariant by design: DINOv2 was trained on diverse
    natural images and its ViT features are dominated by semantic content
    (pose, character shape) rather than background texture patterns.
