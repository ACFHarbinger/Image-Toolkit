    """§1.2D — Drop near-static interior frames using temporal variance across triplets.

    For each interior frame *i* (not first or last) compute the mean per-pixel
    variance across the consecutive thumbnail triplet
    (thumbs[i-1], thumbs[i], thumbs[i+1]).  Thumbnails are in [0, 1] float32.
    If the mean variance is below ``sigma_threshold``, the frame contributes no
    new motion information and is dropped.

    **Why this is different from the other near-dup filters:**
    - §1.2A / §1.2C operate on displacement edges — they require a non-zero
      match displacement to detect statics.
    - §1.2B compares *selected* frames post-selection.
    - §1.2D acts on the raw thumbnail sequence pre-selection, catching frames
      where both the camera and the character are stationary, regardless of
      whether the matching step would later produce a near-zero edge for them.

    First and last frames are always kept to preserve canvas extent.
