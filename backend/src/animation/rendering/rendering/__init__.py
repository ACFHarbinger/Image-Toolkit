"""Temporal rendering: median, first-frame, and Laplacian-blend renderers (§5.17 split).

All functions are standalone — they take ``frames``, ``affines`` and (where
applicable) ``bg_masks`` as explicit arguments.

Split by role:

                            (module-qualified access -- see its docstring)
  _gpu_median.py         -- §3.11A GPU-accelerated nanmedian
  _gain_correction.py    -- §1.40/§1.41 sequential photometric gain/bias
  _phase_clustering.py   -- per-pixel FFT animation-phase detection
  _animation_repaint.py  -- animation-phase re-render (shared by median's
                            fast + chunked paths -- deduplicated, see its
                            docstring)
