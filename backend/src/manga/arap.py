"""As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) mesh puppeteering (roadmap §3.3, issue #194).

The highest-effort item in the manga colorization/animation roadmap:
deterministic, mesh-based deformation of a static panel -- the counterpart
to Live2D-style puppeteering. An artist drags a small subset of "anchor"
vertices to new positions; the rest of the mesh follows in a way that
locally preserves rigidity (no shear/stretch) as much as possible, per
Sorkine & Alexa's As-Rigid-As-Possible surface modeling energy, adapted here
to a 2D triangle mesh with per-triangle (not per-vertex) rotations, matching
issue #194's own stated formulation ("per-triangle optimal rotation via
SVD").

**Algorithm**, alternating two steps until convergence:

1. *Local step*: for each triangle, given the current vertex position
   estimate, find the rigid rotation ``R_t`` (2x2 orthogonal, det=+1) that
   best explains how that triangle's edges have moved from their rest
   lengths/directions -- the classic 2D orthogonal Procrustes problem,
   solved via SVD.
2. *Global step*: with every triangle's ``R_t`` fixed, solve for new vertex
   positions minimizing ``sum_t sum_{edges in t} |(q_j-q_i) - R_t(p_j-p_i)|^2``
   -- a sparse linear least-squares problem whose normal equations are
   exactly a graph Laplacian over the mesh's edges (each triangle occurrence
   of an edge contributes weight 1), solved once per iteration via
   `scipy.sparse.linalg.splu` with anchor vertices pinned via the same
   Dirichlet row-replacement trick `colorization.py`'s `_solve_chrominance`
   already uses for scribbled pixels. The Laplacian itself doesn't depend on
   the rotations (only on mesh topology and rest positions), so it's
   factorized once and reused across iterations.

**Scope of this module vs. issue #194's full scope, documented
transparently:** this ships `arap_deform()` (the core solver) and
`generate_mesh()` (grid-sampling + Delaunay triangulation over a caller-
supplied binary mask, filtered to the mask's interior). It does **not**
ship a rigging UI (drag control vertices) or real-time re-solve GUI wiring
-- issue #194 explicitly lists those as part of its ~2+ week scope, and this
module is the deterministic algorithmic core they'd sit on top of, following
this session's established pattern of shipping backend mechanisms ahead of
GUI wiring (see issue #191's own two-part delivery). It also does **not**
depend on automatic character isolation (issue #184, line art extraction --
itself unbuilt, needing external PiDiNet/model integration): `generate_mesh()`
takes any caller-supplied binary mask, matching the roadmap's own established
"manual-mask MVP first" pattern used elsewhere (§1.1). Pure Python/NumPy/
SciPy, not the roadmap's originally-proposed C++ `base::manga::arap_deform()`
Eigen kernel -- the same deliberate, documented deviation this session's
other solvers (`colorization.py`, `temporal.py`, etc.) already made, for the
same reason: avoids a new build-system surface before the algorithm itself
is proven correct; SciPy's sparse LU solver and NumPy's SVD are fast enough
for interactive-scale meshes (hundreds of vertices).

    Samples a regular grid of points at ``grid_step`` spacing, keeps only
    the points that fall inside the mask, Delaunay-triangulates them, and
    discards any triangle whose centroid lands outside the mask (so the
    mesh doesn't bridge across concave gaps/holes via the triangulation's
    convex-hull tendency). Vertices left unreferenced by any surviving
    triangle are dropped and the remaining ones re-indexed contiguously --
    an unreferenced vertex would otherwise leave a structurally zero row in
