"""Levin et al. (SIGGRAPH 2004) "Colorization Using Optimization" -- quadratic-
cost scribble-based colorization, solved as a sparse linear system.

Reference: ``research/Manga Colorization and Animation Research.md`` §5.1
(``docs/moon/roadmaps/manga_colorization_animation.md`` §2.1, issue #186).

An artist provides a sparse set of colored scribbles on a grayscale line-art
image. Each unscribbled pixel's chrominance is expressed as a locally-weighted
average of its neighbors' chrominance, with weights derived from luminance
correlation (pixels of similar intensity are assumed to share color; a strong
intensity change -- e.g. a drawn line -- breaks the correlation and acts as a
natural color-boundary). This yields a large, extremely sparse linear system
(~9 nonzeros per row for a 3x3 window) that is solved once per chrominance
channel.

Deliberately a pure Python/NumPy/SciPy implementation for this first pass,
not the roadmap's originally-proposed C++ ``base::manga`` Eigen kernel --
SciPy's sparse LU solver is fast enough for interactive single-page use
(a 512x512 image solves in well under a second) and this avoids opening a new
CMake/pybind11 build-system surface just to ship the first working version.
A native port remains open as a follow-up if profiling shows it's needed for
multi-page batch throughput.

        chrominance is solved for, so line art / screentone detail is never
        blurred away by the solve itself. Note this is the YCrCb-space
        guarantee, not a pixel-exact guarantee on the final RGB output: an
        8-bit YCrCb->RGB conversion is not perfectly invertible when the
        solved chrominance would push a pixel out of the RGB gamut (the
        intermediate BGR values clip to [0, 255]), which can perturb the
        recovered Y by a few levels if you convert the RGB output back to
        YCrCb yourself. This is a property of 8-bit color-space round-
        tripping in general, not specific to this solver.
