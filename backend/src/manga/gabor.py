"""Screentone texture features via a Gabor filter bank (roadmap §1.3, issue
#185).

Manga screentones (dense arrays of pure black/white dots, cross-hatching)
consist entirely of extreme binary pixels, which artificially maximizes
local intensity variance and breaks the intensity-continuity assumption the
plain Levin scribble colorizer (``colorization.py``) relies on -- see
``research/Manga Colorization and Animation Research.md`` §5.2. Projecting
the image into a Gabor texture-feature space (local spatial
frequency/orientation response) gives a signature that represents the
*structural rhythm* of a screentone rather than its raw pixel intensity, so
two pixels inside the same halftone pattern score as similar even though
their raw intensities may be polar opposites (a dot vs. the gap beside it).

        frequencies: spatial wavelengths (in pixels^-1) to filter at; manga
            screentone dot pitches are typically small (a few pixels), so
            the defaults favor higher spatial frequencies.
        ksize: Gabor kernel size (odd; larger catches lower-frequency
            patterns but costs more per-pixel convolution).
