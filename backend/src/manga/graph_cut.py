"""Graph-cut (Boykov-Kolmogorov) temporal coherence refinement (roadmap
§3.2, issue #193).

§3.1's 3D quadratic-cost propagation (``temporal.py``, issue #192) solves a
single combined sparse linear system across a whole sequence, which works
well when local intensity tracking between adjacent frames is reliable, but
degrades under fast motion/occlusion: a big intensity jump between frame
``t`` and its temporal neighbors distorts the intensity-correlation weights
the Levin solver leans on, which can leak an implausible chrominance value
into a frame even though the *rest* of the sequence solved cleanly. This
module adds a second pass that treats the whole sequence's already-solved
per-frame chrominance (typically ``temporal.py``'s
``colorize_scribble_sequence()`` output) as a *label hypothesis* and uses a
Boykov-Kolmogorov min-cut/max-flow solve (via `PyMaxflow
<https://github.com/pmneila/PyMaxflow>`_, which wraps Boykov & Kolmogorov's
reference C++ implementation -- not reimplemented here, per the roadmap's
own recommendation) to decide, per pixel, whether to keep that value or fall
back to a neighbor-frame-blended alternative.

**Formulation and deliberate simplification.** The roadmap's MRF energy is
``E(L) = sum_p D_p(L_p) + sum_(p,q) V_p,q(L_p,L_q)``, generically over an
open-ended label set (e.g. one label per candidate color). A full
multi-label alpha-expansion solve is real scope creep for a first pass --
it needs repeated per-label binary sub-solves and a submodularity-safe
smoothness term across arbitrary color pairs. Instead, mirroring this
session's other modules (see ``colorization.py``, ``optimal_transport.py``,
``temporal.py`` docstrings for the same kind of documented, deliberate
narrowing), this module ships a **2-label binary graph-cut per frame**:

* Label ``OWN``: trust this frame's own already-solved chrominance
  (typically from ``colorize_scribble_sequence()``).
* Label ``BLEND``: distrust it, and fall back to the chrominance of its
  temporal neighbor frame(s) at the same spatial location instead (the mean
  of frame ``t-1`` and ``t+1`` for interior frames, or the single available
  neighbor at a sequence boundary).

This exactly matches the roadmap's stated pain point (suppress flicker/
inconsistency where §3.1 broke down under fast motion) without requiring an
open-ended label space -- the two competing hypotheses considered are
"trust this frame" vs. "trust its neighbors", the natural binary reduction
of the general formulation for a *coherence-refinement* pass (as opposed to
a from-scratch colorization pass, which is what §2.1/§2.4/§3.1 already do).

**Data term** ``D_p(L_p)``: for each pixel, ``flicker_p`` is the L1 distance
between the OWN and BLEND chrominance hypotheses (0 if they already agree,
so the label choice is free either way), and ``motion_p`` is the mean
absolute grayscale intensity difference to the available temporal
neighbor(s), normalized to [0, 1] -- a proxy for exactly the failure mode
this module targets: a big appearance change between frames is where local
intensity-correlation tracking (which §3.1's solver depends on) is least
trustworthy.

* ``D_p(OWN)   = data_weight * motion_p * flicker_p``
* ``D_p(BLEND) = data_weight * (1 - motion_p) * flicker_p``

High motion + high flicker pushes the cut toward ``BLEND`` (distrust the
frame's own solve where tracking plausibly broke down); low motion + high
flicker pushes it toward ``OWN`` (the disagreement isn't explained by
motion, so there's no reason to override the original solve). When
``flicker_p`` is ~0 both costs are ~0 and the smoothness term alone decides
(pulling the pixel toward whatever its neighborhood already prefers).

**Smoothness term** ``V_p,q(L_p,L_q)``: a Potts penalty (0 if
``L_p == L_q``, a positive constant otherwise) weighted by Gabor
texture-feature distance between ``p`` and ``q`` (``gabor.py``, issue #185),
using the *exact same* Gaussian-kernel affinity ``screentone.py`` already
uses for its own smoothness/halting term: ``w_pq = exp(-||T(p)-T(q)||^2 /
(2*sigma^2))``. This keeps the OWN/BLEND decision spatially coherent within
a texture region (e.g. a whole screentoned patch flips together rather than
pixel-by-pixel salt-and-pepper), which is what prevents the refinement pass
from *introducing* its own flicker. Symmetric-Potts-with-nonnegative-weight
pairwise terms are submodular, which is exactly the condition
Boykov-Kolmogorov's binary min-cut requires for an exact (not merely
approximate) solution -- unlike general multi-label alpha-expansion, no
approximation guarantees are needed here.

Unlike ``colorization.py``/``temporal.py``'s configurable ``win_rad``
window, the smoothness term here is over the standard 4-connected
(von Neumann) pixel grid -- the conventional neighborhood for image
segmentation graph-cuts (including the original Boykov-Kolmogorov papers'
own examples) and the natural fit for PyMaxflow's grid-graph helpers.
