"""Preference-vote logging for the future LocalDPO/LoRA alignment pipeline
(roadmap §6.3/§4.1/§4.2, issue #197).

The Preference Review Dialog (`gui/src/components/manga_preference_dialog.py`)
is built as a stub ahead of the DPO/LoRA alignment pipeline itself -- per the
roadmap's own "build early" rationale, preference data collection should
start as soon as any generative colorization mode ships, rather than being
retrofitted once the training loop exists. This module is that stub's
storage layer: every A/B vote is appended as one JSON line to a local log
file, immediately readable (via :func:`read_preferences`) by whatever future
training script consumes it, with no schema migration step needed to adopt
it later.

A flat JSON-lines file was chosen over SQLite (the roadmap's own text says
"SQLite/JSON") because an append-only vote log has no query/update/deletion
requirements -- SQLite's transactional guarantees and query engine would be
unused machinery for a workload that's just "append a record, read them all
back later." JSONL is human-inspectable, needs no new dependency, and is
trivially concatenable if preference logs from multiple installs are ever
merged for training.
