# ASP Roadmap — Match or Exceed the OpenCV Stitcher on Every Benchmark Test

*Created 2026-07-09, immediately after the S200 great trim and the post-trim full
benchmark. Supersedes the retired 3,596-line roadmap (kept at `archive/moon/asp.md`
for reference — read it as a catalogue of what was already tried, not as a plan).*

**Objective.** For all 97 benchmark tests, the ASP output should be at least as good
as the OpenCV SCANS simple stitch — *as judged by a human* — and better on the
dimensions where the ASP is architecturally advantaged (coverage/framing, sub-pixel
sharpness, absence of periodic banding). "At least as good" explicitly includes the
coherence guarantee: the ASP must never lose a test by producing torn anatomy,
duplicated strips, or misordered content.

**Starting position (2026-07-09 baseline, `anime_stitch_20260709_030853.json`):**
27 asp_better / 41 comparable / 29 simple_better; aligned GT-SSIM 0.693 vs 0.718;
51 true composites + 46 guarded fallbacks; 87 s/test. The composite-quality wall is
frame-selection pose gaps (documented since June and still true). Authoritative
state: `.agent/cache/asp_state_of_the_pipeline.md` + `asp_benchmark_2026-07.md`;
strategy rationale: `research/ASP_Critical_Evaluation_2026-07-08.md` (§9); research
base: `research/Image_Stitching_Research.md` (the consolidated field reference) and
`research/ASP_Comprehensive_Research_Report.md` (algorithm specs, decision
thresholds, datasets) — see §R below for the distilled results this plan builds on.

**Full-corpus checkpoint (2026-07-28, `anime_stitch_20260728_013215.json`)
— first full-97 run since the baseline, after this session's accumulated
fixes (ToonOut default-on, aligned-SSIM windowing fix §0.4b, Hugin/Overmix
comparators, several rejected experiments confirmed staying default-OFF):**
21 asp_better / 54 comparable / 22 simple_better; aligned GT-SSIM (post-fix
metric, not directly comparable to the pre-fix baseline number above) 0.6656
vs 0.693; 43 true composites + 54 guarded fallbacks; 83.8 s/test; sharpness
91.3 vs 65.0 and ghosting 59.0 vs 76.0 (ASP wins both, the architecturally-
advantaged dimensions the objective calls out). Both real-composite rate
(43 vs 51) and `asp_better` count (21 vs 27) dropped vs the 07-09 baseline —
**this reads as a net-honest shift, not a regression**: ToonOut's masking
fix and the seam_vis_gate re-examination (S244) both independently found
cases where a *flawed* real composite correctly reclassifies as a *safe*
fallback once measured more accurately, which mechanically shrinks both
numbers while improving actual shipped quality. Fallback-class breakdown
(supersedes the 18-test-sample estimate in Phase 4 below with full-corpus
numbers): `seam_vis_gate` 27, `composite_gate_sb` 26, `composite_gate_sc` 1,
`ghost_gate_siqe` 0, `alignment_failed` 0 (confirms test49's resolution
holds at full scale, not just the earlier 18-test sample). This run also
serves as Phase 2.6's full-corpus host-freeze-fix confirmation (issue #25).

---

## Ground Rules (carried from the critical evaluation — non-negotiable)

1. **One change → one benchmark → keep or revert.** 5-test verify
   (`just asp-benchmark-verify`) per change; full 97 (`just asp-benchmark`, ~2.5 h)
   before any default flips. Record the JSON filename in the item when done.
2. **Human visual verdict outranks every metric.** No item is "done" on SSIM alone;
   side-by-side montages (ASP | simple | Overmix | GT) are part of the definition of
   done. No automated metric currently measures structural coherence.
3. **Budgets:** ≤ ~50 env flags, ≤ 10 gates (a new gate displaces an old one),
   roadmap ≤ ~350 lines. Shipped items move to `docs/moon/CHANGELOG.md`; failures get a
   one-paragraph post-mortem in `.agent/cache/asp_benchmark_*.md` — they do not
   accrete here.
4. **The human owns priorities and quality calls; agents implement and measure.**

**⚠ Benchmark host-freeze — likely fixed 2026-07-27, not fully re-verified.**
`bench_anime_stitch.py` repeatedly froze the host; root cause found (uncapped
OpenMP/BLAS/OpenCV/PyTorch thread pools) and fixed (capped to 4 threads) —
see 2.6 below. One clean 5-test run confirms the fix at that scale. **Prefer
small-to-moderate batches and watch system resources during any run larger
than previously tested** until a full-corpus run has confirmed it holds at
scale.

## §R — Research Base (already established; do not re-survey)

The two research reports in `research/` were written against this exact problem and
remain valid. Their load-bearing results, so future sessions build on them instead
of re-searching:

**Established and shipped (still in the trimmed core):** translation/affine-only
geometry (homography/APAP provably ill-conditioned on flat cels — rank-deficiency
argument, `Image_Stitching_Research.md §2–3`); the matcher recipe EfficientLoFTR →
ALIKED+LightGlue → template/phase-correlation → RoMa (§4); GNC-TLS bundle
adjustment (Yang 2020, 70–80 % outlier tolerance, μ-anneal /1.4); BiRefNet masking;
A5 fg-excluded median; ARAP Push→Regularise (Sýkora 2009) + symmetric midpoint warp
(StabStitch++ principle); A6 single-pose escalation (Eden 2006).

**The master principle** (research §8/§20, now proven twice by our own benchmarks):
*never average two conflicting poses — warp to agreement or select one; a skipped
frame beats a torn average.* Phase 2 below is this principle promoted to policy.

**Vetted-but-unused results to draw from (with their report anchors):**
- *Flow:* SEA-RAFT fine-tuned on **LinkTo-Anime** (2506.02733; cel-rendered GT
  flow) for flat-cel aperture failures; AnimeInterp **SGM** segment-level flow as
  the non-ML alternative; cross-validate any LinkTo-Anime training on **ATD-12K**
  (domain gap: 3-D-rendered vs hand-drawn — report §21.3).
- *Masking:* **ToonOut** (BiRefNet fine-tune, 95.3 → 99.5 % anime pixel accuracy)
  as a drop-in weights upgrade; **SAM-2** only after the 20-clip validation gate
  (report §21.1) — it is not officially benchmarked on anime.
- *Pose similarity for selection:* DWPose/ViTPose joint embeddings or fg-only flow
  magnitude — the background-confounded gradient metric is a documented failure.
  ConvGRU is a non-transformer flow-refinement alternative, worth a look only if
  SEA-RAFT/SGM both underperform.
- *Photometric:* Brown–Lowe joint gain (the §3.1 blocks solve below is its full
  form); **reverse-dimming** (Harding flash-test dimming is real in broadcast
  sources — `anime-undimmer`); region-stratified Reinhard or trapped-ball palette
  harmonisation (Hungarian match in Lab) instead of continuous colour transfer.
- *Seam:* graph-cut with hard t-link constraints is the *correct formalism* for
  single-pose regions (Eden 2006/Boykov–Jolly — our §4.2 failure was wiring, not
  theory); anime rule: weight seam cost by `(1 − edge_strength)` so seams run
  *along* strong line-art, not across flat fills; **DSeam** for speed if graph-cut
  returns; Intelligent Scissors is superseded by graph-cut, not worth building
  separately. **OBJ-GSP + SemanticStitch** (mesh-based, character-aware seam
  barrier) is a structurally different formalism — parked as a Phase-5 stretch
  candidate, not a Phase-1/3 alternative, since it's a new dependency class.
- *Blending:* **Modified Poisson Blending + MTOR** fixes the colour-bleeding that
  ruled out plain Poisson on flat cels; multi-band remains the default choice.
- *Datasets:* ATD-12K, AnimeRun, LinkTo-Anime, PaintBucket-Character, Sakuga-42M
  (report §22) — for any fine-tuning experiment.

**Do NOT adopt (report §21.2, plus trim-era additions):** UDIS++/SRStitcher
wholesale (natural-photo priors); VidPanos for bg completion (hallucination risk —
prefer ProPainter if bg completion returns); warp α > 0.5 on raw flow (test27
0.709 → 0.558); fg bbox crop without scroll-axis awareness; mpdecimate for anime
telecine; ToonCrafter without an LPIPS/CLIP quality gate (non-deterministic by its
authors' own warning). Overmix is GPL-3.0: run it as an external tool, re-implement
ideas clean-room, never link.

## Phase 0 — Measurement Foundation *(everything else depends on this)*

### 0.1 Human coherence ratings for the current baseline  `[tool rebuilt
2026-07-29, S266, issue #123; UI feedback pass 2026-07-30, S267 — rating pass
itself is HUMAN, ~45 min, still open]`
**The actual rating pass is still open** — building the tool doesn't do the
human judgment it exists to collect. **This is the metric the objective is
defined against**, and the explicit prerequisite for flipping any of Phase
2's measured-positive flags (2.1, 2.3) to default-on.

**Tool: two surfaces over one source of truth**
(`data/benchmarks/asp_evaluations_YYYYMMDD.json`), entry point
`backend/controllers/bench_eval_dispatch.py --surface {inspector,triage,ingest,sync}`:

- **`just asp-benchmark-assess`** — the PySide6 inspector
  (`backend/benchmark/evaluation/ui/`). N-way comparison of every comparator a
  test has (ASP / OpenCV (SCANS) / Overmix / Hugin / GT), reorderable by
  dragging a panel's title bar, in four switchable layouts with zoom **and
  pan** locked across panels; a hover pixel-value magnifier (works at any
  zoom, not just deep in); live comparison maps (difference / SSIM /
  false-colour / swipe / blend / checkerboard / edge overlay / contour) with
  real sliders; the per-test benchmark metrics and §11.1–11.5 diagnostics on
  their own "Analyze" tab; the benchmark's own plots and 100+ stage renders
  (with a horizontal/vertical filmstrip toggle); region/link annotation
  (N-way chains, point or region endpoints) with a defect class + severity; a
  Settings dialog (default save directory, dark/light theme); and a
  keyboard-first scoring form (0-4 scores the focused panel, `A`/`S`/`Tab`
  focus, `[`/`]`/`=` preference, `Ctrl+0-9` defect tags, `Space` next) sized for
  the ~28 s/test this section budgets.
- **`just asp-triage`** — the optional FiftyOne surface
  (`backend/benchmark/evaluation/plugin/`, extra `benchmark-eval`). One group per
  test, one slice per comparator; every metric and human judgment a filterable
  field; defect tags; 5 saved views. The surface for corpus-level questions —
  notably `human_disagrees_with_metric`, which is the raw material §0.2's open
  calibration item needs. Needs a reachable MongoDB (`just asp-triage-db`);
  `fiftyone-db` ships no `mongod` for Ubuntu 26.04.

Division of labour is a capability boundary, not taste: FiftyOne's App has no
label drawing (annotation is delegated to CVAT/Label Studio), its `PlotlyView`
exposes no relayout event so `drawrect` can't round-trip, and it has no pixel
probe or live compositing slider — exactly the inspector's half.

**Schema** is additive and backward compatible: `asp`/`simple`/`notes`/`bboxes`/
`edges` are written exactly as before (`_load_human_evaluations()` only reads
`asp`/`simple`), plus per-dimension sub-scores (coherence / sharpness / framing
/ seams / colour), pairwise preference + confidence, an 11-class defect
taxonomy, per-region defect class + severity, and `reviewed`/`skipped` flags.

The predecessor (S222's OpenCV window, S260's PySide6 dashboard) had 10
confirmed defects catalogued in issue #123 — Pixel Value Mode was a complete
no-op, Back-after-Skip was impossible, `--redo` stopped after one test, a
merely-*visited* test was written with null scores and then excluded from the
queue forever, and the whole per-test metrics block was loaded and never
displayed. All fixed, with 198 tests where there were none.

### 0.2 Coherence-aware verdicts  `[veto logic done 2026-07-27, S222;
metric-calibration part still open — needs real rating data to run against]`
- **Done**: `bench_anime_stitch.py` now loads the most recent
  `data/human_ratings/asp_ratings_*.json` (if any) and adds a
  `"human_coherence": {asp, simple, notes}` field per dataset (`None` if
  unrated). The verdict may not report `asp_better` when the ASP coherence
  rating is below the simple stitch's — implemented as a one-directional veto
  (a human "asp better" preference does *not* force-upgrade a metric verdict,
  only vetoes a false `asp_better` the human disagreed with, matching the
  spec literally); `verdict_source` becomes `"human_coherence_veto"` when this
  fires. Summary JSON gets `human_coherence_rated` / `human_coherence_veto_count`
  coverage counts. Verified against a synthetic ratings file (asp<simple →
  veto fires; asp>simple → no override; unrated → no override) — this closes
  the test84/test53/test07 class of false `asp_better` verdicts, pending real
  rating data to confirm at scale.
- **Still open**: calibrating the 12 automated metrics against the ratings
  (rank correlation per metric, demoting anything that disagrees with humans
  to "diagnostic-only") — needs an actual rating pass (0.1) to have data to
  calibrate against; can't be built ahead of that.
  **Data collection for it is now in place (2026-07-29, S266)**: the rebuilt
  tool records per-dimension sub-scores, a pairwise preference with confidence,
  and defect-taxonomy tags per test and per region — so a metric can be
  correlated against the specific dimension it claims to measure rather than
  only against a single 0-4 blend. The FiftyOne surface exposes a derived
  `human_disagrees_with_metric` field, which matters because the veto above is
  one-directional by design: every disagreement it does *not* veto was
  previously invisible. None of this substitutes for the pass itself.

### 0.3 Overmix as a third comparator on the full corpus  `[DONE 2026-07-28 —
full 97-corpus smart-variant run complete; see .agent/cache/overmix_field_notes.md]`
- **Done**: `OvermixCli` built from source via `desktop/linux/scripts/setup_overmix.sh`
  (GPL-3.0 — external tool, never linked; needed a pinned `wgpu-native` release
  and a local FFmpeg-API-compat patch committed in the submodule's own history,
  see field notes for why). `backend/benchmark/run_overmix.py` feeds each
  dataset both the *smart-selected* frames (same input ASP gets, saved to
  `output/overmix_stitch.png`) and, with `--full`, the *full* raw frame set
  (`output/overmix_full_stitch.png`) — plus `output/overmix_variant.json`
  (aligner/comparator/render settings, frame counts, timing). `_build_result`
  and the report now carry `metrics_overmix`/`overmix_path` and a three-way
  image + CV-metrics table per test, plus an "SC OM" summary column — purely
  a reference comparator, no change to the asp-vs-simple verdict logic.
- **5-test verify result**: 3/5 tests (test04/08/09) produced clean, coherent
  Overmix composites; 2/5 (test27/57) showed heavy multi-copy ghosting —
  `RecursiveAligner`'s whole-frame translation model has no fg/bg split, so it
  fails when foreground animation dominates over background camera motion.
  Full write-up (including the CLI settings that actually worked — `Gradient`
  comparator, not `BruteForce`, which didn't finish in 90s at full res) in
  `.agent/cache/overmix_field_notes.md`.
- **Full 97-corpus run complete (2026-07-28)**: `python -m backend.benchmark.run_overmix`
  (smart-selected-frames variant, no `--full` — that variant is a separate,
  heavier artifact this exit gate doesn't require) against all 97 datasets.
  **97/97 succeeded, zero failures/timeouts**, ~5 minutes of actual
  `OvermixCli` compute time (per-test `wall_sec` summed from each
  `overmix_variant.json`) plus Python-side frame-selection overhead for the
  full run. Confirms the thread-cap fix ([[feedback_benchmark_freezes_host]]/
  issue #25) holds for this comparator tool too, not just `bench_anime_stitch.py`
  itself. Every dataset now has `output/overmix_stitch.png` +
  `output/overmix_variant.json`.
  **Not yet done**: merging these into a single consolidated four-way
  summary JSON/report the way `bench_anime_stitch.py`'s own run does —
  `bench_anime_stitch.py` has no metrics-only/recompute mode, so pulling
  Overmix's per-test artifacts into the same report as ASP/Simple would
  currently mean a full ~2h22m pipeline re-run just to backfill comparator
  columns. Left as a separate, explicitly-scoped follow-up rather than
  forcing an expensive re-run into this session; the per-test data itself
  (the actual deliverable this phase's objective needs) already exists for
  all 97.

### 0.4 Kill the GT-coupling measurement bug  `[(b)+(c) done 2026-07-27; (a)
still open, blocked on the Phase 0.1 human rating pass; (d) still optional]`
Every past frame-selection improvement was vetoed by GT-SSIM because the GT
panoramas were assembled from specific frame timings. Fix the measurement, not the
selection: score selection experiments by (a) human rating, (b) aligned-SSIM
*computed on the overlap of content actually present in both images*, and (c)
seam-band pose-residual statistics (mean `post_warp_diff` across seams — lower =
easier compositing). **(c) implemented**: `_composite_foreground` already
collected `seam_post_diffs` internally (via `seam_meta_out`) but nothing read
it; the benchmark now passes `seam_meta_out={}`, computes the mean excluding
single-pose-escalation sentinels (phase-boundary/user-override, which aren't a
measured warp residual), and surfaces it as `"mean_post_warp_diff"` in the JSON
and a report line. **Verified (S220)**: values are stable and near-identical
between an `ASP_BG_AVERAGE` A/B (11.71→11.69, 13.51→13.35, 2.91→2.91, etc.) —
correctly orthogonal to a flag that only touches background rendering, not
foreground seam registration.
**(b) implemented (S231)**: `_compute_aligned_ssim` previously averaged SSIM
over the *entire* GT-dimension canvas after ECC alignment, including the
`warpAffine`'s `BORDER_REPLICATE` padding (wherever alignment shifted content
off an edge) and any genuinely non-overlapping frame coverage — both measure
framing/coverage differences the metric wasn't meant to capture, not pose or
sharpness quality. Now builds a real-content validity mask for both images
(warped with `BORDER_CONSTANT`/zero-fill, never replicate, so padding never
counts as "real"), intersects them, and averages the `ssim(..., full=True)`
per-pixel map only over that overlap (falling back to the old whole-canvas
mean when the overlap is too small — <500px — to trust a windowed mean).
Verified on the 5-test set directly from already-rendered outputs (no pipeline
rerun needed — this only changes benchmark-side metric computation): values
shift by small, principled amounts (test04 +0.025, others <0.003) and no
GT-based verdict flips on this sample — a stabilizing correction, not a
destabilizing one.
(a) remains open — needs the Phase 0.1 rating tool's actual rating pass (a
human task) before anything can be calibrated against it. Optional (d):
SI-FID as a reference-free signal for non-GT tests — still unbuilt, only
worth it if (a)+(c) leave those tests hard to rank.

### 0.5 Optional second reference: Hugin  `[5-test verify done 2026-07-27 —
see .agent/cache/hugin_field_notes.md; full 97-corpus run still open]`
- **Done**: system `hugin-tools`/`enblend`/`enfuse` (apt) as the CLI
  toolchain — `vendor/Hugin` (the ACFHarbinger fork submodule) turned out
  not to build these tools at all (its CMake only wires up
  `align_image_stack`; `cpfind`'s subdirectory is commented out), so the
  system packages are used instead; the submodule stays for potential
  future GUI/build work. `backend/benchmark/run_hugin.py` runs
  `pto_gen -> cpfind -> autooptimiser -> pano_modify -> nona -> enblend`
  on each dataset's smart-selected frames (`output/hugin_stitch.png`) and,
  with `--full`, the full raw set. `metrics_hugin`/`hugin_path` wired into
  `bench_anime_stitch.py`/the report exactly like Overmix (§0.3) — the
  report's tables are now four-way (ASP/Simple/Overmix/Hugin).
- **5-test verify result**: only 1/5 (the 9-frame test) succeeded; the
  other 4 (22-26 frames) failed with a degenerate ~470,000px canvas.
  Root cause: Hugin's rectilinear/cylindrical projection models a rotating
  camera, and our planar-scroll content pushes the fitted FOV toward the
  180° projection singularity once enough frames accumulate — not a
  wiring bug, confirmed via three rejected fix attempts (cylindrical
  projection, dropping `autooptimiser -s`, a fixed bounded FOV) in the
  field notes. Added a fast-fail canvas-size guard (>20,000px aborts
  immediately) so this degenerates into a clear, fast error instead of a
  5-minute `nona` timeout or an opaque `std::bad_alloc`.
- **Practical implication**: Hugin's usable comparator coverage on this
  corpus is inherently partial (roughly <15-20 frame sequences only) —
  expect the same pattern at full-97 scale, not something to keep chasing.

**Phase-0 exit gate:** ratings file exists; benchmark emits coherence + pose-residual
columns; Overmix and Hugin columns present for all 97; a four-way summary table in
the report.

---

## Phase 1 — Targeted Information Gathering *(parallel with Phase 0)*

### 1.1 Literature sweep — updates since the reports, not a re-survey  `[2–3 days reading]`
`research/Image_Stitching_Research.md` (consolidated 2026-06) already covers the
field through mid-2026; search only for what postdates or fills its gaps, and
append findings to that report so it stays the single reference:
- **Animation-phase clustering:** the reports cover hold detection (FD-Means,
  dHash) and Overmix's AnimationSeparator but no dedicated phase-clustering
  literature — search "animation cel phase detection", "cartoon keyframe
  clustering", "inbetweening detection". This is the one genuinely uncovered topic.
- **Anime optical flow after LinkTo-Anime (2506.02733):** released fine-tuned
  RAFT/SEA-RAFT checkpoints usable off the shelf; AnimeRun successors. (If a
  public cel-tuned checkpoint exists, it replaces our own fine-tune plans.)
- **Joint seam + exposure optimization:** the reports treat seam finding (§11) and
  gain (§9) separately, and our GraphCut measurement showed exactly that split
  failing — search for joint formulations (seam-cut energy with photometric terms).
- **Ghost-free fusion for dynamic scenes, 2024+:** the reports cite DDFNet/FDAN/
  SMURF as the flow→warp→fuse ancestry; look for pick-one-source attention fusion
  that maps onto phase-consistent reconstruction (2.3).
- **Pose-conditioned generative inbetweening:** ToonCrafter successors — reading
  only; the report's caveat stands (non-deterministic; mandatory quality gate),
  and no implementation happens until the Phase-2 core wins.

**Done 2026-07-27** (issue #21): swept all five gap areas, findings appended to
`research/Image_Stitching_Research.md` §21 addendum. Summary: animation-phase
clustering remains genuinely uncovered (no dedicated literature found, confirming
this is our own diagnostics work to own); LinkTo-Anime's fine-tuned checkpoint
public availability is inconclusive (treat as unavailable until directly
verified); joint seam+exposure optimization has no strong new hit — JoPano
(Dec 2025) is a tangential generative-panorama method, but its Seam-SSIM/
Seam-Sobel metrics are a usable idea for our own benchmark; ghost-free fusion
has genuinely new relevant work — UltraFusion and IFT (both 2024-2025), worth a
closer read before the next foreground-assembly iteration, not yet integrated;
ToonCrafter's successor is LayerInbetween (ACM ToG, July 2026), reading-only,
not yet evaluated against ASP's failure cases.

### 1.2 Overmix deep-dive (hands-on, pairs with 0.3)  `[(a) answered
2026-07-27 — REJECTED as a phase-detection alternative; (b) partially
answered 2026-07-27; (c) still open — see .agent/cache/overmix_field_notes.md]`
Specifically answer: (a) how does `AnimationSeparator`'s error-threshold
change-point behave on hentai pan shots with 2–4 animation phases? (b) does its
average-render on *our* bg regions beat our temporal median visually? (c) what does
its interactive workflow do that our HITL checkpoints don't? Feed answers into 2.1.
**(a) answered — mismatched, not adopted**: read the source first —
`AnimationSeparator` is a greedy backlog-based de-interleaver built for
*cyclically-repeating* animation loops (separating a walk-cycle's distinct
cels into buckets), not scene-level phase-boundary detection on a
monotonically-drifting scroll. Ran it on two tests where ASP's own
`detect_animation_phases()` finds 3 coherent phases each (test27: 8/2/11
frames; test09: 4/7/11 frames): AnimationSeparator fragmented them into 12
and 16 groups respectively (mostly singletons) — structurally different
behavior, not a threshold-tuning gap. **Not adopted** as a phase-detection
alternative or cross-check for §2.2; ASP's own dHash+robust-MAD detector is
the right tool for this input structure.
**(b) partial**: on the 5-test verify's 3 clean composites, average-render
backgrounds looked sharp and coherent, no clear win or loss vs ASP's median at
a whole-canvas glance — a rigorous background-only crop comparison wasn't done.
(c) not yet explored (needs the GUI, out of CLI-automation scope).

### 1.3 GraphCut post-mortem experiment  `[REJECTED again, 2026-07-27 — see
.agent/cache/asp_graphcut_postmortem_2026-07-27.md]`
Fixed the two identified wiring gaps (distance-transform feathering + local
per-boundary gain correction; widened `ASP_GC_FEATHER_PX` 8→96px to match the
DP path's scale). 5-test verify: GraphCut's real seam quality got *worse* on
4/5 tests despite the fix, and the one test that passed the gate produced a
visibly corrupted image (dense scan-line artifacts a naive sharpness metric
scored as "great"). Root cause is architectural, not wiring: the low-res
seam-estimation proxy likely fragments into thin alternating ownership bands
on flat anime cel content, which feathering can't repair. `ASP_GRAPHCUT_SEAM`
stays default OFF; do not revisit without addressing the fragmentation
hypothesis first (see the post-mortem for the two candidate fixes, neither
attempted). The anime edge-cost rule was also not attempted — OpenCV's
`GraphCutSeamFinder` exposes no hook for a custom cost function short of
reimplementing the min-cut algorithm.

---

## Phase 2 — Coherence-First Core (the actual quality plan)

*Rationale: the simple stitch wins because adjacent frames ⇒ `A_animation ≈ 0`.
Give the ASP the same property via animation-phase awareness, instead of trying to
warp incompatible poses together. Evaluation §9.2 has the full sketch.*

### 2.1 `ASP_HOLD_AVERAGE=1` A/B  `[done — measured at full-corpus scale, S214/S217]`
Overmix-style ECC sub-pixel averaging within hold blocks. Needed real
engineering before it was even measurable — the benchmark had its own
disconnected frame-selection reimplementation; see `docs/moon/CHANGELOG.md` S214
for the consolidation + bugs found/fixed (both pre-dated this work and
already affected the GUI path). **Full-corpus (S217, n=96/97, combined with
2.3's flag — not isolated) vs the 2026-07-09 baseline**: CV verdict 31/36/27/2
(was 27/41/29/0); aligned GT-SSIM 0.694 vs 0.719 (was 0.693 vs 0.718 — flat,
expected: preprocessing win, not the pose-gap fix 2.4 targets); sharpness
+56%, ghosting −26%; 44/96 guarded fallbacks (was 46/97). Real,
non-regressive, not a breakthrough. **Stays default OFF** pending the human
visual pass (0.1) the ground rules require before any flag flips.

### 2.2 Animation-phase grouping at ingestion  `[done — S215/S217]`
`detect_animation_phases()` + `phase_spans()` in `ingestion/frame_selection.py`:
dHash change-point detection over the *selected* frame sequence, same
primitive as hold detection one level up. Measurement-only (JSON diagnostics
+ phase-strip PNG); zero behavior change confirmed. Full-corpus phase census
(n=96): 1–6 phases/test, mean 2.18, 60/96 tests multi-phase — the structure
2.3 targets is the common case, not an edge case.

### 2.3 Phase-consistent compositing  `[done — S216/S217; human ratings
(the actual success criterion) still open]`
`ASP_PHASE_COMPOSITE=1` (default OFF): seams whose two frames belong to
different phases skip midpoint-warp entirely and escalate to single-pose
from the dominant phase, via `_dominant_frame_in_band` in `compositing.py`.
`phase_ids` computed once in `AnimeStitchPipeline.run()`, shared by GUI and
benchmark (see `docs/moon/CHANGELOG.md` S216 for an index-alignment bug caught
before shipping). 5-test verify: neutral-to-slightly-better, 8 seams
correctly escalated, spot-checked visually coherent. Full-corpus: see 2.1's
numbers (run combined). Human ratings — the roadmap's actual Phase-2.3
success criterion ("zero coherence-class losses among true
composites" needs eyes on images, not SSIM) — have not run; that's the
next step before either flag can flip to default-on.

### 2.4 Phase-aware frame selection  `[REJECTED, 2026-07-27 — see
.agent/cache/asp_phase_aware_select_postmortem_2026-07-27.md]`
Implemented and 5-test verified: `ASP_PHASE_AWARE_SELECT` (default OFF) adds
a Pass-2 tie-break penalty against camera-step candidates that would cross
into a different candidate-level animation phase than the previous anchor.
Mean seam `post_warp_diff` did not drop (8.90→8.99 across the 5 tests, flat
to slightly worse) and one test (`asp_test57`) flipped from a safe SCANS
fallback to a real ASP attempt with visible seam/registration corruption —
a real regression, not a metric artifact. Flag stays OFF; do not re-enable
without a different mechanism (see post-mortem).

### 2.5 Background quality: Overmix-style averaging  `[REJECTED again,
2026-07-27 — see .agent/cache/asp_bg_average_postmortem_2026-07-27.md]`
`ASP_BG_AVERAGE=1` (default OFF) in `rendering.py` blends the per-pixel
temporal median toward the mean as confirmed-background sample count grows.
First measurement (S220) attributed the visible strip-banding to an abrupt
mean/median switch at the count boundary; this session fixed that (smooth
blend weight, `ASP_BG_AVERAGE_FULL_AT`) and re-measured. The banding
persists — root cause is unrelated to the switch's abruptness: some source
frames carry fine block-structured overlay content whose block boundaries
don't survive warp-then-average across misaligned frames, regardless of
blend weight. Flag stays OFF; do not re-attempt without addressing frame
content alignment for such overlays specifically, not the blend curve.

**Phase-2 exit gate:** on the 55-GT subset, ASP human coherence ≥ simple on every
test; aligned-SSIM gap ≤ 0. (Coverage wins like test96 should start flipping
`comparable` → `asp_better` once coherence losses stop cancelling them.)

---

## Phase 2.6 — Benchmark-Harness Host Freeze *(FIXED, confirmed at full-corpus
scale 2026-07-28 — issue #25 closeable)*

`bench_anime_stitch.py` repeatedly froze the host badly enough to force a
hard restart, on a 128GB RAM / 24GB VRAM machine — a real bug, not
underpowered hardware. **Root cause**: nothing in the codebase capped
OpenMP/BLAS/OpenCV/PyTorch thread pools, so each defaulted to one thread per
CPU core independently, stacking uncoordinated (numpy BLAS, OpenCV
`parallel_for_`, PyTorch intraop, the C++ `base` extension's own OpenMP in
`canvas.cpp`) — confirmed by the user's own `htop` observation. **Fix**:
`OMP_NUM_THREADS`/`OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS`/`MKL_NUM_THREADS`/`NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS`
capped to 4 (`ASP_BENCH_THREAD_CAP`) before numpy/cv2/torch import, plus
`cv2.setNumThreads`/`torch.set_num_threads`. **Confirmed**: the exact 5-test
combination that previously froze the host completed cleanly with the fix —
RSS/RAM/VRAM flat across all 5 datasets, thread count settled at 22–34 (not
growing). Permanent diagnostics also added: `_resource_snapshot()`/
`_resource_danger()` abort guardrail (RAM≥80%/VRAM≥85%) and `_log_resource(tag)`
per-stage checkpoints in `process_dataset` — note these *failed* to prevent
one freeze before the thread-cap landed, so they're a backstop, not the fix.

**Confirmed at full-corpus scale, 2026-07-28**: user-authorized full 97-test
run (`anime_stitch_20260728_013215.json`) completed cleanly end-to-end —
8540.6s total (~2h22m, 83.8s/test avg), zero `_resource_danger()` triggers
across the entire run, no host freeze. This supersedes the earlier 5-test
and 18-test partial confirmations from this session and closes the "not
fully trusted at scale" caveat this phase carried since S218-S220.
Escalation path if a freeze ever recurs (lower `ASP_BENCH_THREAD_CAP`
further; audit `frame_selection.cpp`/`fg_register.cpp`/`compositing.cpp`/
`seam.cpp`/`exposure.cpp`; check model `.offload()` VRAM release) remains
documented below as a reference, not because it's still believed needed.

## Phase 3 — Photometric & Seam Parity with OpenCV

*(Only after Phase 2 — these polish composites that must first be coherent.)*

- **3.1 Joint canvas-space blocks-gain solve** `[MIXED, 2026-07-27 — see
  .agent/cache/asp_joint_gain_solve_postmortem_2026-07-27.md; stays default
  OFF]` — implemented the full Brown–Lowe 2007 formulation as specified
  (`ASP_JOINT_GAIN_SOLVE`, one least-squares system over all overlapping
  frame pairs with a bg-only, luminance-scalar, clamped gain-prior term,
  replacing §4.10's sequential chain). 5-test verify: genuine wins on 2/5
  (test08/09 — reduced visible banding, one gained a fallback→real
  composite with more coverage), roughly neutral on 2/5, and one new
  regression (test04: nudged the aggregate composite-gate score just past
  its threshold, producing a real composite with a local banding defect the
  finer-grained seam_visibility metric catches but the gate's aggregate
  statistic didn't). The approach works; the gate needs a matching
  finer-grained local check before this can default-on — not attempted here
  to keep this one measurement to one change.
  **Follow-up REJECTED, 2026-07-27** (see
  `.agent/cache/asp_dense_band_scan_gate_2026-07-27.md`): built the
  recommended finer-grained local check (`_dense_band_scan_score`, a full
  sliding-window scan vs `_strip_banding_score`'s frame-boundary-anchored
  sampling), wired into the composite gate. 5-test verify across both
  conditions (default OFF, `ASP_JOINT_GAIN_SOLVE=1`): the new metric never
  crossed its calibrated floor on any test — zero measured effect on any
  verdict. Bigger finding: **test04's original regression no longer
  reproduces** against the current codebase — the ToonOut masking fix
  (S230, landed after this postmortem was written) already changed test04's
  pixel composition enough that the *pre-existing* `sb` check alone now
  correctly gates it (`sb=40.4>35`) without any new metric. Reverted per
  the anti-goal against unproven new gates; the architectural sampling gap
  is real but currently unexercised by any known failing case, so it's
  parked. `ASP_JOINT_GAIN_SOLVE`'s own disposition should be re-measured
  fresh in a future session against the current ToonOut-inclusive baseline
  rather than inherited from this now-partially-stale postmortem.
  **Re-verified same day**: 5-test re-run against the current baseline is
  cleaner than the original — test04 now safely reverts to SCANS instead of
  shipping the defect, test08/57 unaffected (already SCANS via ToonOut
  either way), test09 still flips SCANS→real (coverage win), test27 still
  real→real (modest win). Zero regressions on this sample. **But** a direct
  look at test09's output still shows visible banding despite passing every
  gate — the same "gates pass, defect remains" pattern, just below current
  thresholds. **Stays default OFF**: ground rule #1 requires a full-97 run
  before any default flip regardless, and ground rule #2's actual gating
  requirement (Phase 0.1's human coherence rating pass) is still open — this
  5-test re-verify is encouraging, not a substitute for either.
- **3.2 GraphCut revisit** — moot; 1.3 did not survive its second measurement
  (2026-07-27).
- **3.3 Multi-band blend on final boundaries — ALREADY DONE, stale roadmap
  text corrected 2026-07-27.** This bullet's premise ("reintroduce the
  deleted C++ `multiband_blend`") is factually wrong: `base::laplacian_blend`
  (`base/src/animation/compositing.cpp`) is a genuine 5-level Laplacian
  pyramid multi-band blend — not deleted, not a stub, and already the live
  default (`LAPLACIAN_BANDS=5`, `backend/src/constants/animation.py`),
  called from `_laplacian_blend` at Stage 11's per-seam blend
  (`compositing.py:2295`). It was never removed; this bullet appears to
  predate that check, or confused it with a different retired component.
  **This reframes Finding-3's visible test09 banding** (Phase 4 analysis,
  `.agent/cache/asp_phase4_fallback_class_analysis_2026-07-27.md`): since a
  5-band blend is already active and the banding still shows through, the
  defect is **not a blending-method gap** — multi-band blending is already
  the technique in place. It points back toward an upstream photometric
  (gain/exposure) mismatch as the real remaining lever, consistent with why
  §3.1's joint gain solve (not a blending change) is what actually moved
  test09 to a real composite. No code change from this correction — closing
  this item as already satisfied rather than re-implementing something that
  exists. (The "MPB + MTOR for colour bleeding" caveat remains relevant
  research-base context if colour-bleeding specifically — as opposed to
  luminance banding — is ever observed, but is not itself evidence of a gap
  to fill.)
- **3.4 Cheap photometric candidates from the research base** `[done
  2026-07-27 — see .agent/cache/asp_toonout_fix_2026-07-27.md]`
  — **ToonOut weights**: the "mirror is gone" blocker was itself stale — a
  live mirror exists (`joelseytre/toonout` on HF). Locating it surfaced a
  real, previously-unknown bug: `TOONOUT_MODEL`/`BIREFNET_MODEL` were
  swapped, the intended fallback repo ID was never a valid HF model repo,
  and even fixed, the wrapper's weight-loading didn't handle this repo's
  filename or its `module._orig_mod.`-prefixed checkpoint — ToonOut had
  **never** actually been loaded, ever; every run silently used plain
  generic BiRefNet. Fixed all three layers and verified a real mask-level
  difference (not just "loads without erroring"). 5-test verify: 3 tests
  improve or trade a flawed real composite for a clean fallback, 1
  unaffected, 1 (test04) exposes the same gate-threshold fragility the
  §3.1 postmortem already documented (any quality improvement nudges it
  just past the gate without fixing the underlying local defect — a
  gate-design gap, not specific to this fix). Kept as the new default (bug
  fix restoring intended behavior, not a speculative feature — no flag).
  — **Reverse dimming**: checked as instructed before building. Sampled 3
  tests' gain plots for Harding's signature (a sudden luminance *drop* on
  risky frames) — found only smooth monotonic drift or isolated
  *brightening* spikes (opposite direction), already handled by the
  existing coherence gate. This R18/OVA corpus was never likely subject to
  Japanese broadcast-safety dimming in the first place. Not built.

---

## Phase 4 — Convert the Fallback Classes

The 54 guarded fallbacks (full-corpus count as of the 2026-07-28 checkpoint,
`anime_stitch_20260728_013215.json` — supersedes the 46-count pre-trim
census) are wins-by-safety, not wins. Full-corpus class breakdown:
`seam_vis_gate` 27, `composite_gate_sb` 26, `composite_gate_sc` 1,
`ghost_gate_siqe` 0, `alignment_failed` 0 — confirms the 18-test sample's
proportions held at scale (seam_vis_gate and composite_gate_sb dominant,
the other three classes negligible-to-zero). Reclassify each:
- **seam_vis_gate class (27 at full-corpus scale, 2026-07-28; re-examined
  2026-07-27 on an 18-test targeted sample — see
  `.agent/cache/asp_phase4_fallback_class_analysis_2026-07-27.md`):** **not
  uniformly "mostly pose-blend artifacts" as originally assumed.**
  Cross-referencing `seam_visibility` against the existing
  `mean_post_warp_diff` metric splits this class into two different root
  causes: some are genuinely pose-blend-driven (high on both metrics,
  e.g. test41: sv=63.8, post_warp_diff=44.7), but several of the *worst*
  seam_visibility scores in this sample occur on tests with *low*
  post-warp-diff (test08: sv=143.3 but post_warp_diff=15.3; test37: sv=65.6
  but post_warp_diff=6.7) — meaning registration is fine and the defect is
  photometric (banding/exposure), not torn or misaligned content. Tested
  whether `ASP_JOINT_GAIN_SOLVE` (§3.1, still default OFF) rescues the
  photometric subset: 2/7 flip to real composites (test09, test32), 3/7
  improve without crossing the gate (test37/08/57), but 2/7 actually
  *regress* under gain solve (test41, and notably **test51**, whose
  post-warp-diff is comparably low to test32's yet responds in the
  opposite direction) — `mean_post_warp_diff` correlates with outcome but
  isn't clean enough on its own to build an automatic per-test dispatch
  rule from. **Follow-up checked same day**: tried frame/pair count as a
  second candidate discriminator (`_joint_gain_solve` builds its
  least-squares system over all sufficiently-overlapping pairs, not just
  adjacent frames, so fewer selected frames means fewer constraining
  pairs) — test51/test41 (the two regressions) do have the fewest pairs
  (28, 45), but **test08 breaks the pattern** (36 pairs, second-fewest, yet
  *improved*). Two independent cheap heuristics now each checked and each
  falls short on a real counter-example — not a matter of finding the
  right one-line rule; closing this specific follow-up, a full per-test
  measurement pass is what's actually needed. No code shipped from this
  round; still needs full-97 data and a real per-test triage pass before
  this class can be meaningfully "converted" rather than just
  better-understood.
  — **Full-97 triage pass built and run, 2026-07-28** (`backend/benchmark/triage_fallback_classes.py`,
  new tool — parses every fallback's `fallback_reason` gate values,
  cross-references `mean_post_warp_diff`/pair count, sorts by
  margin-over-limit; full report:
  `.agent/cache/asp_phase4_fallback_triage_full97_2026-07-28.md`).
  Deliberately a triage table for human review, not a new automatic
  dispatch rule — both candidate one-line rules above already failed on
  real counter-examples, and the anti-goals rule out shipping a third
  guess as pipeline behavior. Full-corpus qualitative split (by the same
  `mean_post_warp_diff` bucketing as the 18-test sample, threshold <10 vs
  ≥30): only **1/27** seam_vis_gate tests is clearly pose-blend-leaning
  at full scale (test41) — the "mostly pose-blend artifacts" framing this
  whole section opened with is even more wrong at 97-test scale than the
  18-test sample suggested. 10/27 are clearly photometric-leaning, 15/27
  fall in the ambiguous middle this bucketing can't resolve (which is the
  same "no clean rule" finding, not a new gap). **14/27 (52%) are
  borderline** — within 10 points of the 35.0 limit — meaning a modest,
  targeted photometric-quality improvement (not a new gate, an actual fix
  to whatever's causing the banding/exposure defect in the photometric
  subset) could plausibly flip a meaningful fraction of this class without
  needing to solve the "mixed/moderate" cases at all. `composite_gate_sb`
  (26 tests) is structurally similar: median margin only 9.6 over its 35.0
  limit, 8/26 within 5 points. **This is now a "what's the actual
  photometric defect" investigation, not a "which heuristic dispatches
  correctly" one** — the next real step is picking 2-3 of the most
  borderline photometric-leaning tests (e.g. test87 margin=0.4, test10
  margin=1.3, test71/test69 margin~3.5) and visually diagnosing what
  specifically is wrong with their seam photometrics, not further
  cross-metric correlation attempts.
- **render-gate class (21) — clarified 2026-07-27:** this is the benchmark's
  own umbrella term (`timings["render_gate_fallback"]`, set to 1 or 2
  whenever *any* post-render quality check fires) covering
  `composite_gate_sc`/`composite_gate_sb`, `ghost_gate_siqe`, and
  `seam_vis_gate` combined — not a separate, unexamined class. The
  seam_vis_gate re-examination above (Findings 1-5,
  `.agent/cache/asp_phase4_fallback_class_analysis_2026-07-27.md`) already
  covers a meaningful chunk of this umbrella at 18-test scale, including
  4 `composite_gate_sb` and 1 `composite_gate_sc` case from this batch.
  The original fg-dominant high-animation-scene concern is still open and
  still needs the deliberate policy decision below — best single-phase
  reconstruction (2.3 degenerate case) vs SCANS, picked per-test by
  measurement. Accepting SCANS permanently for some tests is a valid
  outcome **if a human confirms SCANS is the best achievable** — the
  objective is "never worse than the OpenCV stitcher", which a coherent
  fallback satisfies; but each such test must beat the *raw* cv2 stitcher
  (our SCANS-on-preprocessed-frames already tends to, via selection +
  photometric prep + no crop failures).
- **alignment_failed (test49): SUPERSEDED, 2026-07-27** — test49 no longer
  fails at alignment. It now reaches the composite stage and fails at
  `composite_gate_sb` instead (`sc=39.3/limit 53.2, sb=47.1/limit 35.0`,
  `mean_post_warp_diff=20.3`), most likely as a side effect of the ToonOut
  masking fix (S230) changing the BiRefNet output that feeds bundle
  adjustment and the alignment health check. The corpus's one dedicated
  `alignment_failed` case is resolved; test49 now belongs to the
  `composite_gate_sb` class discussed above like any other test in it — no
  further individual diagnosis needed under this heading.

**Phase-4 exit gate = the objective:** for every one of the 97 tests, ASP output
human-rated ≥ the simple stitch, with `asp_better` on the coverage/sharpness
dimensions wherever a true composite ships.

---

## Phase 5 — Exceed (stretch, unscheduled)

Only once Phases 0–4 hold: per-phase super-resolution output (Overmix's actual
specialty — √N sub-pixel averaging), optional Real-ESRGAN anime_6B or APISR finish
(the two report-vetted anime SR models, §15), GC/multi-band refinements, OBJ-GSP +
SemanticStitch mesh-based seam barrier as a third seam candidate (§R), and
revisiting generative seam synthesis with whatever 1.1 found — each as a measured
A/B, and any generative step behind the report-mandated LPIPS/CLIP quality gate.

---

## Parked (real gaps, explicitly deferred until the Phase-4 exit gate)

*Carried forward from the archived roadmap — these are engineering/research items
with unimplemented value that were never benchmarked or rejected, unlike the §5.x
gate factory. They are out of scope until every one of the 97 tests clears Phase 4,
but should stay visible rather than silently vanish.*

- **Full 2D canvas geometry for horizontal/diagonal scroll** (Category F/H in the
  archived taxonomy). Non-vertical scroll only gates to SCANS today; touches
  canvas/warp/seam code that assumes 1D vertical layout — high blast radius,
  multi-week, do not start before Phase 4.
- **StabStitch++ multi-axis trajectory smoothing** — wave correction is linear
  today (`np.polyfit` deg=1, §4.3); pairs naturally with the 2D-canvas item above,
  probably not worth doing alone.
- **HITL manual-correction primitives** (Fourier-Mellin manual align, arrow-based
  flow override). The evaluation credits Overmix's interactive workflow as good
  product design (§8); revisit only if Phase 2's automated compositing leaves a
  test class no automated policy can resolve.
- **ASP → HybridStitch handoff** — integration into the main app's general stitch
  tab, once quality no longer needs the benchmark harness to validate every change.

---

## Anti-Goals (do not do these; the archive documents why)

- No new quality gates or per-strip/per-seam statistics without a displaced gate
  and a full-corpus run (§5.x factory, 104 items, zero measured value).
- No threshold-tuning sessions (±0.002 SSIM outcomes, weeks lost).
- No new default-OFF flags "for later" — implement behind a flag only with the
  A/B run scheduled in the same session.
- No Phase-2-era ambitions (video ingestion, dataset harvesting, RLHF, 4K hybrid)
  until the Phase-4 exit gate is met.
- No trusting `asp_better` without looking at the image.
