# Browser Extension Roadmap — Capture, Build System, and Desktop-App Integration

*Created: 2026-07-04. Covers the `extension/` WebExtension ("Save Image to Folder") — its build infrastructure, capture/UX upgrades, and integration with the Image Toolkit desktop app (Django API `api/`, `PhashDeduplicator`, BGE-M3/Qdrant vector search).*

## Current State

The extension is a minimal image-saving helper:

- **`background.js`** — creates a "Save to selected directory" context-menu item on images; downloads `info.srcUrl` into `Downloads/<targetFolder>/` via `downloads.download` with `conflictAction: "uniquify"`; also receives `download_image` messages from the content script.
- **`content.js`** — "Turbo Mode": when enabled, intercepts click/pointer/touch events in capture phase, finds an `IMG` under the cursor via `elementsFromPoint`, blocks the site's handlers, and messages the background to download `img.src`.
- **`options.html/js`** — popup with target-folder text field + turbo checkbox, persisted in `storage.local`.
- **Manifests** — three hand-maintained copies: `manifest.json` (MV3), `manifest_chrome.json` (MV3), `manifest_firefox.json` (MV2, `browser_specific_settings.gecko`). `extension/webpack/` exists but is empty.
- Browser API differences handled ad-hoc via `typeof browser !== 'undefined'` + duplicated Promise/callback wrappers in every file.

Untapped app-side capabilities: `PhashDeduplicator` (`backend/src/core/phash_deduplicator.py`, shipped §4.6), pgvector/Qdrant + BGE-M3 vector search, the Django REST API (`api/`, OpenAPI-documented since §4.5), and the C++ `base` image core.

## 7.1 Webpack Multi-Browser Build System

**Status: ✅ Shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** `extension/webpack/` builds all four targets; the three hand-written manifests were deleted; `just build-extension` added.

**Pain point:** Three hand-maintained manifest copies (`manifest.json`, `manifest_chrome.json`, `manifest_firefox.json`) drift apart; there is no build step, no minification, no way to emit per-browser packages for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave.

**Approach (selected):** Webpack 5 build in `extension/webpack/`:

```
extension/
├── src/                       # source of truth (TS after §7.2)
│   ├── background.ts
│   ├── content.ts
│   ├── options/{options.html,options.ts}
│   └── shared/                # api adapter, storage, types
├── webpack/
│   ├── webpack.common.js      # entries, ts-loader, CopyPlugin (icons, html)
│   ├── webpack.chrome.js      # merge(common) + manifest for chrome
│   ├── webpack.firefox.js
│   ├── webpack.edge.js
│   ├── webpack.brave.js
│   └── manifest/
│       ├── manifest.base.json         # shared keys (name, version, icons, …)
│       ├── manifest.chrome.json       # MV3 service_worker, host_permissions
│       ├── manifest.firefox.json      # gecko id, background.scripts fallback
│       ├── manifest.edge.json         # chrome-compatible; store-specific keys
│       └── manifest.brave.json        # chrome-compatible
└── dist/{chrome,firefox,edge,brave}/  # unpacked builds + zips
```

- A small `GenerateManifestPlugin` (or `webpack.DefinePlugin` + `CopyPlugin.transform`) deep-merges `manifest.base.json` with the per-browser overlay and stamps `version` from `package.json`, emitting a single generated `manifest.json` per target — the three hand-written manifests in `extension/` are deleted.
- npm scripts: `build:chrome`, `build:firefox`, `build:edge`, `build:brave`, `build:all`, `watch:<browser>`; `just` recipes `build-extension` / `build-extension-all` mirroring the existing `build-frontend` pattern.
- Edge and Brave are Chromium-based: their overlays start as `{}` + store metadata, but having explicit targets keeps store-specific divergence (e.g. Edge `update_url`, future Brave rewards keys) tractable.
- Output zips named `image-toolkit-extension-<browser>-<version>.zip` for store upload.

**Effort:** ~2d · **Impact:** High (unblocks everything else; kills manifest drift)

---

## 7.2 TypeScript Migration & Shared Core

**Status: ✅ Shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** `extension/src/` TS sources with `shared/{api,settings,messages}.ts`; strict mode; `npm run typecheck` clean.

**Pain point:** The `typeof browser !== 'undefined'` adapter and the Promise/callback storage shim are copy-pasted in all three JS files; no types, no shared constants; message payloads are stringly-typed.

**Approach (selected):**
- Move `background/content/options` to TypeScript under `extension/src/`, compiled by the §7.1 webpack setup (`ts-loader`, `@types/webextension-polyfill`).
- `shared/api.ts` — single browser-API adapter (or adopt `webextension-polyfill` so everything is Promise-based on Chrome too).
- `shared/messages.ts` — discriminated-union message types (`DownloadImage`, `DupCheckRequest`, `DupCheckResult`, `IngestImage`, …) shared by background/content/options — this becomes the contract §7.5–§7.8 build on.
- `shared/settings.ts` — typed `storage.local` schema with defaults (`targetFolder`, `turboMode`, per-site rules from §7.10, bridge URL from §7.5).

**Effort:** ~2d · **Impact:** Medium-High (correctness + velocity for the feature work below)

---

## 7.3 Unified Manifest V3

**Status: ✅ Shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** MV3 everywhere; Firefox overlay swaps `service_worker` for event-page `scripts` + gecko id (min 115).

**Pain point:** Firefox manifest is MV2 (`background.scripts`, `browser_action`) while Chrome is MV3; behaviour and permissions diverge.

**Approach (selected):** Target MV3 everywhere. Firefox 109+ supports MV3; the remaining differences are captured in the §7.1 overlays:
- Firefox MV3 uses `background.scripts` (event page) instead of `service_worker` — expressed in `manifest.firefox.json` overlay only.
- `host_permissions` unified; `browser_specific_settings.gecko` kept in the Firefox overlay with a real add-on ID (replace `save-to-folder@example.com`).
- Verify `storage.onChanged`, `contextMenus`, `downloads` parity under Firefox MV3; add `optional_host_permissions` where Firefox requires opt-in.

**Effort:** ~1d (folded into §7.1 overlays) · **Impact:** Medium (one API surface, MV2 EOL-proof)

---

## 7.4 Options Page Redesign

**Status: 🔄 Core shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** Sectioned page (General / Site Rules / Connection / Duplicate Tabs) with template + sidecar + bridge URL/token fields. Remaining: separate slim popup vs full tab split, profile switcher.

**Pain point:** The popup is a single folder field + turbo checkbox; upcoming features (folder profiles, per-site rules, app-bridge status) have nowhere to live.

**Approach (selected):**
- Split **popup** (quick actions: current folder profile switcher, turbo toggle, bridge status dot, "scan this page" launcher for §7.9) from a full **options page** (`options_ui.open_in_tab: true`).
- Options page tabs: *General* (default folder, filename template), *Folder Profiles & Site Rules* (§7.10 editor: domain pattern → folder/profile table), *Image Toolkit Connection* (§7.5: bridge URL/port, token, "Test connection", duplicate-search root directory display), *Advanced* (turbo behaviour, notification prefs).
- Keep it dependency-free (no framework) or Preact-via-webpack if the rules editor gets complex; styled to match the app's dark theme.

**Effort:** ~2–3d · **Impact:** Medium (prerequisite UX surface for §7.5/§7.9/§7.10)

---

## 7.5 Local App Bridge (HTTP → Native Messaging)

**Pain point:** The extension cannot reach any of the app's intelligence (dedup, vector search, ingestion). All integration features need a transport.

**Approach (selected — phased "Both"):**

**Phase A — Local HTTP API (MVP): ✅ Shipped (S208, 2026-07-04)** — `extension_api/` Django app: `GET ping/` + `POST dup-check/`, Bearer-token auth (auto-generated `~/.image-toolkit/extension-bridge/token.txt`), CORS with preflight pass-through, `DirPhashIndex` SQLite-cached phash search (no PostgreSQL needed). `/ingest` and `/similar` remain planned. Original plan:
- New Django app `api/extension/` exposing a small, token-authenticated, localhost-bound surface:
  - `GET  /api/extension/ping` → `{version, features}` (drives the §7.4 status dot)
  - `POST /api/extension/dup-check` (§7.6)
  - `POST /api/extension/ingest` (§7.7)
  - `POST /api/extension/similar` (§7.8)
- Pairing: the app shows a one-time token in its settings ("Browser Extension" section); user pastes it into the §7.4 options page. Token sent as `Authorization: Bearer`. CORS restricted to the extension origin (`chrome-extension://<id>`, `moz-extension://…`).
- Documented via the existing drf-spectacular OpenAPI setup (§4.5).
- Failure mode: bridge unreachable → features degrade gracefully (context items disabled with tooltip "Image Toolkit is not running").

**Phase B — Native Messaging (hardening, later):**
- `com.imagetoolkit.bridge` native host (thin Python script reusing the same handlers) + per-browser host manifests installed by the app (`~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/`, `~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`, Edge/Brave equivalents — Brave reads the Chrome location).
- Advantages once done: no open port, no token UX, browser-mediated authentication; can launch the backend on demand.
- The §7.2 message contract is transport-agnostic so background code switches transports behind one interface.

**Effort:** Phase A ~3d, Phase B ~1w · **Impact:** Very High (unlocks §7.6–§7.8)

---

## 7.6 In-Browser Duplicate Search

*The headline integration feature: "have I already downloaded this image?"*

**Status: ✅ Core shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** Context item → bridge dup-check → notification + popup match list with thumbnails; connection test in options. Verified end-to-end against a live server. Remaining: SHA-256 exact fast path, auto-check on turbo downloads (warn/skip modes).

**Pain point:** Users re-download images they already have. The app has `PhashDeduplicator` (§4.6) but it is unreachable from the browser, where the decision happens.

**Approach (selected):**
- **App side:** user configures a **duplicate-search root directory** in the desktop app's settings (persisted app-side, shown read-only in the extension options). `POST /api/extension/dup-check` accepts `{url}` or `{data_b64}`; the handler:
  1. Fetches the image bytes (server-side fetch avoids CORS/auth cookies issues for most cases; falls back to extension-supplied bytes for login-gated content).
  2. Computes pHash via `compute_phash()`.
  3. Searches the configured root **and its subdirectories**: first against the PostgreSQL phash index (`find_near_duplicates_by_phash`, Hamming threshold ≤ 8) for already-indexed dirs; falls back to an on-demand `PhashDeduplicator.index_directory()` scan (C++ `base.scan_files` + thumbnail decode make cold scans fast; results cached/indexed for next time).
  4. Returns `{matches: [{path, hamming, width, height, thumb_b64}], scanned: n, cold_scan: bool}`.
- **Extension side:** context-menu item **"Check if already downloaded"** on images → badge/notification with result; popup shows match list with thumbnails, path copy button, and (later) "Reveal in Image Toolkit". Optional **auto-check mode**: turbo-mode downloads first call dup-check and skip/warn on hit (configurable: *warn* / *skip* / *save anyway*).
- Exact-duplicate fast path: SHA-256 of bytes compared against an app-side content-hash index before pHash.

**Effort:** ~4d (after §7.5A) · **Impact:** Very High (differentiator; no store extension can do local-library dedup)

---

## 7.7 Send to Image Toolkit

**Status: ✅ Core shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** `POST /api/extension/ingest/` saves into `ingest_dir` (fallback `dup_root/inbox`) with provenance JSON sidecar, uniquified names, implicit dup-check (409 with existing paths, `force` override); "Send to Image Toolkit" context item + notifications. Remaining: embedding/DB indexing at ingest, collection picker.

**Pain point:** Downloads land as bare files in `Downloads/<folder>` with no provenance; the app later has no source URL, page context, or tags, and the vector index only learns about files when a directory is rescanned.

**Approach (selected):**
- Context-menu **"Send to Image Toolkit"** → `POST /api/extension/ingest` with `{url | data_b64, source_page_url, page_title, alt_text, target_collection?}`.
- App saves into its managed library location (or the mapped folder), writes provenance to the DB (source URL, page title, capture timestamp), computes pHash + embedding, and indexes into vector search immediately.
- Dup-check (§7.6) runs implicitly before ingest; duplicate hits return `409 {existing_path}` so the extension can tell the user it's already in the library.
- Later: collection picker submenu fed from `GET /api/extension/collections`.

**Effort:** ~3d (after §7.6) · **Impact:** High

---

## 7.8 Visual Similarity Search from Browser

**Pain point:** "Do I have images *like* this?" — near-duplicates with different crops/resolutions and stylistically similar images are invisible to pHash.

**Approach (selected):**
- Context-menu **"Find similar in my library"** → `POST /api/extension/similar` `{url | data_b64, top_k=12}`.
- App embeds the query image (BGE-M3 visual / CLIP per §5.1 semantic-search infrastructure) and queries Qdrant/pgvector; returns ranked `{path, score, thumb_b64}`.
- Results rendered in an extension popup grid (reuses §7.6 result UI); clicking a result can open the app's gallery at that image (deep-link handled app-side).
- Depends on the app's embedding index covering the library (piggybacks on §5.1 OpenCLIP semantic search work; degrade to pHash-only §7.6 when no embedding index exists).

**Effort:** ~4d (after §7.6; embedding index availability gates quality) · **Impact:** High

---

## 7.9 Bulk Page Grabber

**Pain point:** Saving N images from a gallery/thread page is N right-clicks. Competing extensions (Imageye, Fatkun, Image Downloader) make page-level capture table stakes.

**Status: 🔄 Modes A+B shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** Popup "⬇ Download all media" + "🖱 Select images…" buttons; `shared/pageMedia.ts` collection (images via §7.11 extractor, ≥64px filter, video src/source, blob: skipped); `contentOverlay.ts` click-to-select overlay with floating bar + Esc; batch download via `download_batch` message (§7.10 rules apply). Grid-preview page with filters + dup badges remains planned.

**Approach (selected — two capture modes, per user direction 2026-07-04):**
- **A — One-click "Download all"**: popup/toolbar button → content script collects **all images and videos** on the page (§7.11 extractor for full-res image candidates; `<video src>` / `<video><source>` for videos), dedupes by URL, filters out tiny icons (< 64px rendered, configurable), and batch-downloads through the existing background downloader (§7.10 folder rules + templating apply). Completion notification with count.
- **B — In-page selection overlay**: popup button "Select images on page…" → content script enters overlay mode: page dims slightly, images highlight on hover, **click toggles selection** (colored outline + count badge); a floating action bar (top-center, max z-index) shows the live selection count with **Download selected** / **Cancel** buttons; Esc cancels. Selected items download via mode A's path. Overlay leaves site DOM/styles untouched apart from the injected root node.
- Later (kept planned): grid-preview page with size/format/URL filters and per-item dup-check badges (§7.6 integration: "3 of 41 already in library"); progress UI with per-file status and retry.

**Effort:** ~3d (A+B) + ~3d (grid/filters) · **Impact:** High

---

## 7.10 Per-Site Folder Rules, Filename Templating & Metadata Sidecar

**Status: 🔄 Core shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** `shared/naming.ts`: wildcard hostname rules (first match wins), `{name}/{ext}/{site}/{date}/{time}` template with subfolders, JSON provenance sidecar toggle. Remaining: named folder profiles + context-submenu quick-switch.

**Pain point:** One global `targetFolder` for every site; filenames are whatever the URL had; provenance is lost for plain downloads (when not using §7.7 ingest).

**Approach (selected):**
- **Folder profiles:** named profiles (e.g. "wallpapers", "refs"), quick-switchable from the popup and a context-menu submenu ("Save to ▸ wallpapers / refs / …").
- **Site rules table** (§7.4 editor): ordered `domain-pattern → profile` rules (`*.pixiv.net → art`, first match wins); fallback to active profile.
- **Filename templating:** `{site}`, `{page_title}`, `{alt}`, `{date}`, `{seq}`, `{name}`, `{ext}` tokens, e.g. `{site}/{date}_{name}.{ext}` (subfolders allowed — `downloads.download` supports relative paths). Sanitisation preserved from current `options.js`.
- **Metadata sidecar (optional toggle):** for plain downloads, also emit `<filename>.json` `{source_url, page_url, page_title, alt, saved_at}` via a second `downloads.download` of a data: URL. The app's scanner can ingest sidecars to backfill provenance — bridging the gap for users who don't run the §7.5 bridge.

**Effort:** ~4d · **Impact:** High (most-requested QoL category for this class of extension)

---

## 7.11 Full-Resolution Extraction

**Status: 🔄 Core shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** `shared/extractor.ts`: srcset/`<picture>` scoring, lazy-load attrs, CSS background fallback; wired into turbo mode. Remaining: per-site URL upgrade table, canvas `toDataURL` fallback, context-menu correlation.

**Pain point:** `img.src` is often a thumbnail: `srcset`/`<picture>` variants, lazy-load attributes (`data-src`, `data-original`), CSS `background-image`, and `<canvas>` renders are all missed; sites like Twitter/Pixiv serve downscaled defaults.

**Approach (selected):**
- Shared extractor in `content.ts` used by turbo mode, context menu (via `info.srcUrl` correlation), and the §7.9 grabber:
  - Parse `srcset`/`sizes` and `<picture><source>` to pick the largest candidate by descriptor.
  - Check lazy-load attributes (`data-src`, `data-original`, `data-lazy-src`, common gallery attrs) when present and larger.
  - Resolve CSS `background-image: url(...)` on the hit-tested element chain (extends the existing `elementsFromPoint` walk, which already handles overlay layers).
  - `<canvas>` fallback: `toDataURL()` capture (subject to taint), routed through the message channel as `data_b64`.
  - Optional per-site URL upgrades table (e.g. strip `/thumb/`, `name=small` → `name=orig`) maintained as data, not code.
- Picker returns `{best_url, width?, height?, origin_element}` so the UI can show "1200×1600 (upgraded from 300×400)".

**Effort:** ~4d · **Impact:** High (quality of every saved image; core to the toolkit's purpose)

---

## 7.12 Turbo Mode Polish

**Status: 🔄 Partial (S208, 2026-07-04).** Capture outline-flash feedback shipped. Remaining: badge counter, modifier-key mode, per-site enable list, history panel.

**Pain point:** Turbo mode gives no feedback (was the click captured? downloaded?), is all-or-nothing (global toggle intercepts every left-click on every site), and its event blocking can break sites.

**Approach (selected):**
- **Capture feedback:** brief outline flash + ✓ overlay on the captured `IMG`; badge counter on the toolbar icon; failure toast when the download errors.
- **Modifier-key mode:** alternative to the global toggle — hold a configurable modifier (default Alt) + click to capture without enabling interception globally; pointer cursor changes while held.
- **Per-site enable list:** turbo active only on allowlisted domains (or "everywhere except denylist"), managed in §7.4 and via a popup "enable on this site" toggle.
- **Download history panel:** last N captures (URL, filename, status, dup-check result) in the popup with re-download and "open folder" actions; backed by `storage.session`/`storage.local` ring buffer.
- Uses the §7.11 extractor so turbo captures full-res candidates instead of `img.src`.

**Effort:** ~3d · **Impact:** Medium-High (turbo is the extension's signature interaction; make it trustworthy)

---

## 7.13 Duplicate Tab Highlighter

**Status: ✅ Shipped (S208, 2026-07-04).** `shared/dupTabs.ts` + popup UI; colored `dup ×N` tab groups on Chromium (clear only dissolves our own groups), badge + popup set list everywhere; keep-first/close-rest wired.

**Pain point:** Long browsing/collection sessions accumulate dozens of tabs; the same gallery page or image URL often ends up open in several tabs of the same window, wasting memory and causing double-downloads. Nothing surfaces which tabs are duplicates.

**Approach (selected):**
- **Scan:** popup/toolbar action **"Scan tabs for duplicates"** (plus optional auto-scan on `tabs.onUpdated`/`onCreated`, default off). `tabs.query({currentWindow: true})`, group by **normalized URL** — strip `#fragment` always; strip common tracking params (`utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, …) optionally (configurable); protocol/host case-folded. Groups with ≥ 2 tabs are duplicates.
- **Highlight (Chromium — chrome/edge/brave):** move each duplicate set into a **colored tab group** via `chrome.tabs.group()` + `chrome.tabGroups.update(groupId, {color, title: "dup ×N"})` — cycling through distinct colors per set; this is the strongest native visual signal available. "Clear highlights" ungroups (`chrome.tabs.ungroup`).
- **Highlight (Firefox):** no `tabGroups` API — fallback: badge shows total duplicate count; popup lists duplicate sets (favicon + title + URL) with per-tab *switch-to* / *close* buttons and a per-set *close others* action; duplicates are additionally marked by `tabs.highlight` multi-selection when the user hovers a set in the popup.
- **Actions:** per-set "Keep first, close rest"; "close all duplicates" button with count preview; never auto-closes without explicit click.
- **Permissions:** `tabs` (and `tabGroups` on Chromium) added via the §7.1 per-browser manifest overlays — a concrete first payoff of the overlay architecture.
- **Implementation home:** background service worker owns scan/group state (`shared/dupTabs.ts`); popup renders results via the §7.2 typed message contract.

**Effort:** ~2d · **Impact:** Medium-High (immediate daily QoL; zero app-bridge dependency)

---

## 7.14 App-Powered CV Operations

*Right-click an image → the desktop app's ML stack processes it → result saved or returned to the browser. All items ride the §7.5 bridge and reuse models the app already ships.*

**Pain point:** The app's CV capabilities (BiRefNet, Real-ESRGAN, WD14) are only reachable after a manual download → open-app → find-file → process loop.

**Approach (selected):**
- **A — Background removal:** context item **"Remove background"** → `POST /api/extension/cv/bg-remove` `{url|data_b64}` → app runs BiRefNet (`birefnet_wrapper.py`), returns/saves transparent PNG (`<name>_nobg.png`) into the active folder profile. Long-running: job-id + polling (or SSE) using the app's existing task queue; extension shows a progress badge and notification on completion.
- **B — Upscale before save:** context item **"Upscale & save"** → `POST /api/extension/cv/upscale` `{url|data_b64, scale: 2|4}` → Real-ESRGAN (anime_6B, shared upscaler module CG.2); auto-suggested when the §7.11 extractor reports the best candidate is small (< configurable threshold, e.g. 600px).
- **C — Auto-tag on save:** §7.7 ingest gains `auto_tag: bool` — WD14 (`wd_tagger_wrapper.py`, §4.4) tags computed server-side at ingest; tags stored in DB + optional sidecar; threshold + review-queue semantics reuse `tag_with_review()`.
- **D — OCR extraction + translation:** context item **"Extract text"** → `POST /api/extension/cv/ocr` `{url|data_b64, translate_to?: str}`; app runs OCR (manga-ocr for anime-style text, tesseract otherwise — new small app-side capability) and optional translation (local model, e.g. argos-translate/NLLB via the app; explicit non-cloud default). Result shown in a copyable popup panel with per-block layout; "copy all" + "save as .txt sidecar" actions.

**Effort:** A ~2d · B ~1d · C ~1d · D ~4d (OCR+translate is a new app capability) · **Impact:** High (turns the extension into a remote control for the app's ML)

---

## 7.15 Media Capture Suite

*Extends capture beyond static `<img>` elements to video, animations, and multi-image sequences.*

**Pain point:** Video frames, GIF frames, webtoon strips, and clips are un-capturable today; these are exactly the media types the app's extractor and Anime Stitch Pipeline consume.

**Approach (selected):**
- **A — Video frame grabber:** context item on `<video>` **"Capture frame"** — draw current frame to canvas at `videoWidth×videoHeight` (native res), save as PNG; **burst mode** captures N frames at a configurable interval/step (seeking a cloned muted `<video>` when possible to avoid disturbing playback) and downloads as a numbered sequence — drag-ready input for the app's extractor/ASP tabs. DRM/cross-origin-tainted video degrades gracefully with a clear error toast.
- **B — GIF/animation frame extractor:** context item **"Extract frames…"** on GIF/APNG/animated-WebP → decode in an extension page (`ImageDecoder` WebCodecs API where available; `omggif`/`upng` fallbacks) → frame grid preview with scrubber → save selected/all frames or send-to-app.
- **C — Webtoon capture → ASP stitch:** on long vertical comic pages, **"Capture strip → stitch"** collects the ordered image sequence (§7.11 extractor, same container/class heuristics), sends the list to `POST /api/extension/stitch` → app runs the Anime Stitch Pipeline (or simple vertical concat for trivially-aligned strips) → returns one seamless long image saved to the library. The flagship crossover feature — no other extension can do this.
- **D — Video clip → GIF/WebP:** popup action **"Record clip"** → `MediaRecorder` on `captureStream()` of the target `<video>` for a user-set duration (≤ 30s) → WebM; optional app-side conversion to GIF/WebP via the bridge (ffmpeg already in the app stack) with palette optimization.
- **E — Video downloader with range finder:** context item **"Download video…"** on `<video>` → panel showing the source list (direct `src`, `<source>` variants, and network-sniffed media URLs via `webRequest` where permitted) + a **time-range slider** (start/end thumbnails scrubbed from the video): *full video* downloads directly; *selected range* is cut app-side via the bridge (`ffmpeg -ss … -to … -c copy` for stream-copy speed) or `MediaRecorder` re-capture fallback without the bridge. HLS/DASH streams: detect manifest and delegate segment download+mux to the app (yt-dlp/ffmpeg integration app-side); DRM content excluded.

**Effort:** A ~2d · B ~3d · C ~4d (app endpoint + sequence heuristics) · D ~3d · E ~1w (network sniffing + app-side cutting/muxing) · **Impact:** Very High (C and E are differentiators; A/B feed the app's core pipelines)

---

## 7.16 Image Analysis Utilities

**Pain point:** No way to inspect what an image *is* (metadata, provenance, generation parameters) or whether/where it exists elsewhere, before deciding to save it.

**Approach (selected):**
- **A — AI-metadata / EXIF inspector: ✅ Shipped (S208, 2026-07-04)** — `shared/imageMeta.ts` (PNG tEXt/iTXt/zTXt with DecompressionStream inflate, JPEG SOF/COM/XMP + compact EXIF IFD0 reader, a1111/ComfyUI/NovelAI/InvokeAI detection) + `inspect.html` popup window opened from the "Inspect image metadata" context item; sidecar-save action still planned. Original plan: context item **"Inspect image"** → panel with EXIF/XMP/ICC basics plus **embedded AI-generation metadata**: a1111 `parameters` PNG text chunk, ComfyUI `workflow`/`prompt` JSON chunks, NovelAI/InvokeAI variants — prompt, negative prompt, model/LoRA, sampler, seed rendered in a readable card with copy buttons; "save metadata as sidecar" action. Parsing is pure client-side TS (PNG chunk + JPEG APP1 readers), no bridge needed.
- **B — Reverse-search shortcuts: ✅ Shipped (S208, 2026-07-04)** — "Search image on ▸" submenu (SauceNAO/trace.moe/Lens/IQDB/TinEye) in `background.ts`; custom URL templates in options still planned. Original plan: context submenu **"Search image on ▸"** SauceNAO / trace.moe / Google Lens / IQDB / TinEye (configurable set + custom URL templates in options); opens `service_url + encodeURIComponent(image_url)` in a background tab; data-URL images uploaded via the service's POST form where supported.
- **C — Client-side pHash pre-check:** TypeScript dHash/pHash (canvas 8×8 grayscale DCT) computed locally; the app periodically exports a compact hash snapshot (`GET /api/extension/phash-snapshot` → bloom filter / sorted hash list, cached in `storage.local`); turbo/bulk downloads get instant "probably already have this" hints even when the bridge is momentarily down; authoritative check remains §7.6.
- **D — Local-ML reverse search:** **"Find source/similar (local)"** — embedding-based reverse search against the user's own library using local models only: primary path = app bridge (§7.8 similarity, BGE-M3/CLIP in the app); optional fully-in-browser fallback = quantized MobileCLIP/SigLIP via `transformers.js`/ONNX-Runtime-Web (WebGPU) matching against an exported embedding snapshot for bridge-down operation. Distinct from B: nothing leaves the machine.

**Effort:** A ~3d · B ~1d · C ~3d · D ~1w (browser-side model + snapshot infra) · **Impact:** High (A/B inform the save decision; C/D extend dedup/similarity to offline)

## Phasing & Dependency Graph

**Phase E1 — Build & Language Foundation (~1w):** §7.1 webpack multi-manifest → §7.2 TypeScript → §7.3 unified MV3 → §7.4 options redesign.
**Phase E2 — App Bridge & Duplicate Search (~1.5w):** §7.5A HTTP bridge → §7.6 duplicate search → §7.7 send-to-app.
**Phase E3 — Capture Excellence (~2w):** §7.11 full-res extractor → §7.9 bulk grabber → §7.10 rules/templating/sidecar → §7.12 turbo polish.
**Phase E4 — Deep Integration (later):** §7.8 similarity search (needs §5.1 embedding index) → §7.5B native messaging.
**Phase E5 — CV & Media Suite (parallel to E3/E4 once E2 lands):** §7.16A metadata inspector + §7.16B reverse-search shortcuts (no bridge needed) → §7.15A/B frame grabbers → §7.14A/B/C bg-remove/upscale/auto-tag → §7.15C webtoon stitch → §7.15D/E clip recorder + range downloader → §7.14D OCR+translate → §7.16C/D offline hash/embedding search.
